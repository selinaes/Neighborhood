Joe's place provided all of this and more! \\n\\nThe room was spacious and clean with air conditioning and a heater. I had easy access to all the facilities I needed including a fully equipped kitchen, laundry facilities and 2 bathrooms. Joe went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and went out and bought an ironing board when I asked if one was available for me to iron my shirts with! All the guests that stayed during my 6 weeks were also respectful and friendly which made my trip even better. \\n\\nThe house is in a pleasant residential area which is quiet at night time but close to all important amenities. The nearest supermarket was only 10 minutes walk away and the number 66 bus route had a stop at the top of the road and had a regular service every 5-10 minutes which took me into Harvard Square within 10 minutes. \\n\\nBetween my excellent hosts and the fantastic location I felt completely at home during my stay and would recommend Joe's place to anyone looking visit Boston without paying the ridiculous price of downtown hotels.

We had a great time at Andrea\\'s place. He is very nice and kind. The neighborhood is super nice and we were very happy to have to opportunity to see a real place where real people live: absolutely worth the trip! Furthermore, the house is beautiful, clean, large and comfortable. We definitely recommend it!Adrea was very welcoming and flexible to our needs. Location had surprisingly ample parking and was located in a very good area. The house was beautiful and well kept and we felt very comfortable for the duration of our stay.Andrea made us feel welcome because he made the effort to meet the train at Rosalind Village. \\nThe room was prepared for us including a connection to the Internet which was very helpful.\\nThe house was like others in the street and gave us a sense of history.Me and my friend were so happy about Andrea\\'s room! Everything is clean and tidy. Andrea was very friendly to us. I am not a pet person but I love his dog which is very quiet. Overall we had a wonderful stay!Andrea was a great host. Very nice, helpful, uncomplicated and absolutly recommendable. The room is perfect for two people and everything is very clean and tidy. Also the neighborhood is very nice. Everything that you need is away a few minutes by foot. The ride to Boston Dowtown is very uncomplicated and short too. If i will go another time to Boston  Andrea would be my first contact point.  We were absolutely pleased and happy to be there.    Andrea was really welcoming and gave us precious advices on activities, transport and other useful informations.\\nHis house area is in a calm neighbourhood and not so far from downtown.\\nThe house is large and has everything we need.\\nOur trip was really great!Andrea was really welcoming and a great host. He was very communicative and was very flexible with our check in time as we had car issues on the drive up to Boston. The apartment and neighbourhood is very charming and cute! Highly recommended. Andrea is very friendly.  The room is nice and clean.  He has a cute and quiet dog.  Love this place.  About 25 minutes drive from this place to Boston downtown.  The bed is really comfortable.Andrea is an excellent host!  The location is great and close to everything.  My girlfriend and I had a terrific experience staying with Andrea. He is very welcoming and the place is well kept and inviting. The bedroom was very tidy and the bed was comfortable. Parking on the street is no problem (we parked right in front of the house on the street). His dog is very sociable and well behaved. This was our first airbnb experience and I would not have changed a thing!Andrea is a very kind and generous host. The place is cute and in a great neighborhood.We stayed for one week, and it was a very pleasant experience. The house was clean and comfortable, and it was only a short walk to several shops and restaurants. The room was a bit small, but comfortable, and the kitchen and living areas were very nice. Andrea was welcoming and helpful, taking the time to help me with the printer and the washing machine.Andrea\\'s place is comfortable and stylish. The guest room is very cozy and quiet. The neighborhood is convenient for walking to small shops (Fornax Bread Company is awesome) and parks. Andrea is a pro host. He is so kind and welcoming. I would stay here again in the future. Thanks!Andrea is a very nice host.Communication was superb.  Andrea is personable and flexible, allowing me to come and go as I please.  The space is great, sunshine pouring in with great views from his hilltop residence.  The bed is very comfortable and a good shower.  My dog enjoyed the space and walks around neighborhood.  Lots of kids and families in the area, very safe and quiet.  Highly recommended.  Andrea was very responsive to our questions and welcomed us thoroughly, including our dog.  The house is lovely, as is the neighborhood.  The room in which we stayed was small, but very nice and the air conditioner is in good condition.  The bathroom is very clean and comfortable.  Although the bathroom is shared with Andrea, he is very considerate about making himself scarce during the mornings and evenings when we were using it.  At our request, Andrea allowed us to leave our dog for several hours while we went out to dinner.  Andrea is an extremely pleasant guy, and we enjoyed talking with him.  Our dog liked him, too.  We would definitely go back.Bei Andrea war alles sehr unkompliziert, was ich sehr zu schätzen wusste! \\nDie Lage war für mich pervekt, ausserhalb und doch nah genug der Stadt, welche man mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln sehr einfach und schnell erreichen konnte.\\nZudem, und dies war in meinem Fall das Wesentlichste, er akzeptierte mich mit Hund und zwar, auf eben diese unkomplizierte, gute Art.Andrea was more than helpful when I arrived in Boston. The apartment was nice and spacious with everything you might need. Just a two minute walk from the commuter rail station and even less to the nearest bus. In short, the stay was above expectations and I would definitely recommend Andrea to anyone who\\'s visiting Boston.The house is located in a quiet neighborhood. Everything is just perfect. I will book it without hesitation if I stop by Boston next time.Very nice host !! Would recommend ++! Thx for the parking cues ;)I lived at Andrea\\'s place for 3 nights. It is just 2 minutes from the public transport and very peaceful. Andrea is kind and supportive providing flexible check in times. I highly recommend it for people who come to Boston for the first time. Andrea was a great, friendly host. My girlfriend and I were only in the Boston area for a few days and spent most of our time in Downtown Boston and Cambridge. Public transit is close by but we ended up using a combination of Lyft and Uber for most trips. Lyft seems to be growing in the area but not quite on the same level as SF (where we are from). Roslindale itself seems like a great place to relax and I definitely recommend checking out the Arthur Aboretum just a little bit north. Overall, I would recommend Andrea - great experience for our first AirBnB!Andrea was a nice guy. We didn\\'t have much interaction, but he seemed like a pleasant guy. That being said, and to be honest, I thought the room, specifically the bed and sheets, smelled like they had been used a lot recently. There was a \"greasy\" feeling to the bed and sheets that made sleeping in it less than desirable. The house also had an unpleasant odor that made me a bit nauseous. Again, Andrea was a nice guy, but I thought a better job could have been done in terms of preparing the place for a stranger. We had an excellent stay at Andrea\\'s place during Thanksgiving. Andrea is a friendly host. The room is larger than it looks in the pictures. There is a wardrobe cabinet. In the cabinet there where towels, coffee, tea. Even toothpaste and brand new toothbrushes, in case you forgot them.\\n\\nThe location is just beyond the reach of Boston metro system, but there are good bus connections to the metro.Andrea was a wonderful host and the nearby Roslindale Village has lots of quirky little attractions. His little dog was a delightful addition! Great experience! Short notice booking very responsive and accomodating.  Very calm peaceful environment.Andrea was our first stay using AirBnb and it was everything we could have hoped for. He was very welcoming, friendly, and respectful. The only thing we regret is not being able to spend as much time with Andrea and Mochino! Thank you for an amazing 5 days in Boston! 10/10 would stay again.The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.Andrea was a great and welcoming host, flexible with check in and check out times. The room and the bathroom was very comfortable and clean, and we felt at home. Although we had to take the metro followed by the bus everyday to get to Andrea\\'s house, would still consider it relatively accessible. Great stay overall, recommended! Andrea was a perfect host. The cabinet with fresh toothbrushes for us and a token for a free coffee at the local coffee shop was a nice touch. What a great experience to start our Airbnb journeys. Andrea was a kind and welcoming host. The place was quiet, the room and bathroom were comfortable and clean. I wasn\\'t able to spend time with Andrea but he seems to be a nice guy. Short notice booking very responsive and accomodating. Andrea is a great host. He was able to pick us up from Forrest Hills station as there weren\\'t any busses running anymore. The place is quite nice and very close to the bus stop to Forest hills station. Thanks Andrea for the nice time and of course your hospitality. Andrea was super organized and our stay went off without a hitch! It was a quiet and charming space just as he describes in the listing. Andrea was available and helpful during our stay. The surrounding area was also a nice retreat from the downtown bustle.I loved staying here. The host is very friendly and accommodating. The place is very nice. Would definitely stay here again.Andrea was super nice! He greeted us late in the evening because we had just driven to there from Ohio. He gave us all of the room information quickly and let us crash like the tired puppies we were. He has an adorable dog, too! The room was just as shown and very cozy. Everything was awesome. ']\n",

He's very helpful in every aspect of living and having good time in Boston.\\nSecondly Phil's rental is located in a great area surrounded by parks making it nice and quite and yet it close enough to city center which is easily accessible by walking, biking or taking a bus.\\nRental room is very nice and has all that's needed to make it comfortable!\\nIf I was to do it again i wouldn't be looking for any other place but simple book my stay again at Phil's!Phil was a great host and his home was very comfortable.  The room is well furnished and clean, with a comfortable bed, plenty of closet and drawer space, and a nice desk.  TV and sound system too. Phil was extremely hospitable about use of the kitchen and laundry, as well as helping out with rides.  The backyard is awesome - and in summer weather I imagine it would be a great place to relax.  The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and residential - but close to the commuter rail which takes you to downtown Boston in 15 minutes.  There are some really interesting shops in Roslindale Village - just a 7 minute walk from the house.   Supposedly it has the best farmer's market in Boston. \\n...and...\\nif you enjoy Mexican folk art, Phil's home will be especially fun for you.\\nI highly recommend staying there.Phil is a very friendly host and I felt safe and comfortable in Roslindale. It's a very quiet and nice neighbourhood. You have easy access to the commuter train station at Roslindale Village (if you don't mind walking appr. 15 minutes) - but especially on weekends there is only limited service (on Sundays even no service at all). But you can also take the T orange line to Forest Hill and take a bus (there are several lines). If you like to explore Boston during daytime and have quiet evenings and like walking it's worth a stay.Firstly, the room itself was very comfortable to stay in, and included a firm mattress, ample closet and drawer space, a large desk complete with stereo and TV, powerful air-conditioning, and wi-fi. Beyond the parameters of the room, Phil's home is very clean and comfortable to move around in - and filled with beautiful artisan pieces from Mexico! His stories are as colorful as the art pieces he displays. Beyond his knack for conversation, Phil is a supremely kind host, offering rides and opening his home in ways that made me feel like I was staying with a close relative, not with someone I had just met. Outside of the home, there are restaurants, small shops, and a gorgeous park nearby. Public transportation to downtown and around Boston is easy, as the commuter rail is a 15 minute walk and the orange T-line is a short bus ride away (which can be boarded a block from his home). I can easily recommend staying with Phil with no reservations. The room was very comfortable, with clean and colorful bed, TV, Wi-Fi, desk and closet. And also, I could enjoy many Mexican arts in the house. (for free!)\\nPhil is a great host. He kindly provided me with a bath towel, coffee and breads, a new teeth brush and any useful information on Boston, and also he took me to the station with his car.\\nThe location is calm but the public transportation is limited. If you will come back at late time in weekend, you will have to take a taxi from Forest Hills station (It costs $8 or so) or walk 30 minutes.\\nTotally, I was completely satisfied with staying this room.Phil was very accommodating to both my short notice and preference to stay in for the weekend.  I was able to come and go as I pleased and enjoyed the great art.  The room had a space heater, which was great for being able to make the space comfortable to what I prefer.  I was also appreciative of the location and not having to deal with parking nightmares or traffic.  Phil was a great host.  He was accomodating and helpful.  The room was simple, clean and nice, and his collection of Mexican art added fun and whimsy to the atmosphere.  I had to rent a car while travelling, and parking in front of the house was always available and didn't require a permit.  I'd stay with Phil again!Phil is a wonderful host. The house is located in a charming suburb, with easy access to restaurants and public transport. I enjoyed my stay, and will gladly stay again when I am in Boston. My stay at Phil's was great. Phil is a great host, he is very friendly and willing to help if you need anything. I've got several rides to the supermarket and train station, and also helped me out to find the best routes to bike. He is a great cook too, I was once invited to try lobster and his banana bread is awesome !\\n\\nThe house is clean and quiet and so is the neighborhood. Phil is pretty much all the time attending his online business at the studio, so you won't notice him very much.  The bathroom is shared but is very clean and you will get your own cabinet. \\n\\nI would stay at Phil's again, and I definitively recommend it. If you look for a place that the price is very reasonable with conveniently driving to the city, I'd recommend Phil's place. You can imagine how much to pay to stay in a city. Since we drove, it was pretty handy for us, Phil's place is located only 7-8 minutes away or 10+ minutes with traffic. \\n\\nThe place was clean and comfortable, especially Phil was friendly and helpful. We were welcome to share the kitchen. Some places were not.  Well, for me, to say hello and good bye is pretty important in my culture, therefore, we expected host at least saying such things. Phil was way much over the expectation. Thanks Phil.Phil is a great host who goes over and above to make your stay comfortable.  From rides to the subway station, to sharing his DVD collection, his kitchen and his home.  Great location, interesting conversations and nice cozy clean room.I was in Boston on a business trip that was scheduled with only a few days notice. Staying at Phil's place was perfect for my needs and a terrific introduction to the Airbnb experience. The room was clean with a comfortable firm mattress, work desk, and windows facing east for enjoying morning sunshine.\\n\\nI was welcome to use the kitchen and did for breakfasts but found the local eatery around the corner was super convienient for dinners.\\n\\nPhil had some terrific travel stories that he shared on my last evening in Boston. I would recommend staying here and would definitely stay again.This was my second stay at Phil's place while working in the Jamaica Plain area. This stay was as comfortable, clean, and welcoming as my first visit. We had time to talk about some of the Mexican artwork he sells.\\n\\nPhil's a host who is attentive to his guests and made my stay very easy to unwind after long hours working. If you like being in a large city and having a quiet spot to relax, this is the place for you.Phil was great, helpful and very kind during my staying in Boston. He gave to me all the necessary information to move around the city and helped me also finding another apartment while I was living there.\\nThe place was big enough, confortable and located near public transportaion. I would recommend this place to everyone !! I really enjoyed staying with him.I could not be happier with my first Airbnb experience. Having Phil as a host, to be fair, most likely had something to do with it. The room and environment was exactly as advertised with my space being clean, private and functional. I had full access to Phil's kitchen, bathroom and laundry amenities as needed. Phil himself was pleasantly conversant yet professionally distant to help maintain his and my work schedules. I was able to leave early in the morning and come back late per the duties of a medical student without incident.  I highly recommend Phil's Airbnb listing to anyone wishing to study or needing temporary housing in the Boston area. If I ever needed to return to Boston in similar circumstances, I would surely see if Phil was available. He is a great asset to the Airbnb community. Thanks for a wonderful experience!Staying at Phil's was an excellent way to start off my airbnb journey. Given that I am a noob at airbnb there was a mild hesitation but I am glad I took a leap of faith and stayed at Phil's. Phil is an excellent host and a person. He was very helpful, accommodating and fun to talk with. I had a key to myself and he was fine with me walking in anytime. He gave me access to his washer/dryer in the basement which was very useful. He also suggested a bunch of good places to see around Boston. \\n\\nAbout the house:\\nSafe friendly neighborhood.\\nOld quaint house with lots of character. \\nTons of interesting art pieces (like Phil mentioned in his ad)\\nThe room is spacious for one/two people with ample of storage.\\nThe bathroom is clean and in good condition.\\nPlenty streetside parking available outside.\\nThe house is very close to Arnold Arboretum so it is a great place to be in if you like to explore!\\n\\nOverall I would definitely recommend staying at Phil's if you are around the area.Phil is an excellent host, he went above and beyond by taking me to the train station my 1st morning there to make sure I could find it (it is however only a short walk from the house....very convenient for getting into downtown).  He was also a wealth of information about things I might like to do but would not have discovered on my own. The room is clean and comfortable.  I felt very safe both in his home and in the neighborhood.  Thanks Phil!!!The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.Phil was quick to respond and to reach out before the trip to make sure my stay was a pleasant one. The location was great - quick to the bus stop (but not walkable to the T). Bus service is frequent, so it was fine for me.\\n\\nPhil was super flexible about when I checked in and went out of his way to make me feel welcome. It's clear why he has repeat customers. Breakfast makings available and free reign in the kitchen. Good coffee (french press style) was available (although I ended up running out every morning before taking advantage of it.) \\n\\nTheir is a 7-11 less than a block away as well as a restaurant or two that I noticed. Parking was easy. Super quite and safe neighborhood (I caught the wrong bus one night and had to walk about a mile around midnight). \\n\\nThanks Phil for a great first AirBnB experience!Very quiet neighborhood and Phil opens up his apartment home to make your stay pleasant and stress free. If you stay here there is free street parking and the apartment is less than half a block from the bus stop. The room and the shared bathroom are clean. \\n\\nI've stayed here before and returning for a short stay felt very much like visiting family.Phil was a wonderful host and was very accommodating. The guest room is cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Phil had coffee and bagels waiting for me in the morning and he even gave me a snack for the road. The neighborhood felt very safe and has a bar/restaurant, taco joint and convenience store within walking distance. Parking was no problem. I would recommend this listing and this host. Thanks Phil!Phil was an extremely pleasant and kind host.  He was a very giving person and made the stay that much better.  We had a few chats here and there even though I was busy most of the time.  Location was fine for me.  Very quaint area but not far from it all also.  Very accommodating! Great place! Cozy room. Very safe area. Phil is very nice person! I will definitely stay here next time!I couldn't have asked for a better host for my first few days in Boston. Phil gave me expert advice on how to get around town and even drove me a few places on weekends when the public transportation came less frequently. The neighborhood is full of character and things to do. I leave my highest endorsement. Phil was the absolute best!!  After responding within minutes of my last-second request, he waited up late for my arrival (12:30a) and greeted me with a bowl of delicious, homemade minestrone soup.   He was so kind and gracious throughout my stay.  He even drove me to the T station, so I didn't have to walk.  He was the absolute best and I would stay with him again in a second.  I would give six stars if I could.Phil is an amazing host. Always tried to make my stay more comfortable, and was very helpful. He has a very relaxed attitude, which I found to be very pleasant. The room was quite large, and had everything I could possibly need. The room had two windows with a view of his garden, and the decor was also nice. Phil let me use his kitchen, and it had everything I needed.\\nThe house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood. Bus stops are very near (2 min walking). \\nI would definitely come back!My wife & I stayed with Phil for 2 nights when we came over from the UK for the Boston Marathon.  Phil was a delightful host, with the facilities and ambiance of his place being informal and relaxed; exactly what we required. There was good contact with Phil from before our arrival; he was a really convivial host & more than happy for us to use his kitchen (& eat his banana bread!).  It’s a 10min bus ride from the end of Phil’s street to the Orange Line terminus, so you can be downtown in 30mins.  On Sunday, when the bus didn’t run, Phil generously offered & gave us a ride to the ‘T’.  Phil’s place is clean, private, quiet and just a wee bit quirky, with his pieces of Mexican folk art in which he trades peering at you from all directions!  Some are a little bizarre - but in a nice way!  There’s a sports bar, a Mexican restaurant and a Pizza/pasta takeout just round the corner and a 7-11 at the end of the street.  Overall, we enjoyed our brief stay tremendously; just a shame there wasn’t more time to continue the good conversations.  Thank you Phil – you and your place were just the kind of casual, hassle-free bolthole we needed for our short stay in Boston. I was at Phil's place for 2 weeks for a short work assignment. Staying here was convenient with ample street parking, full use of the kitchen, and a quiet room. \\n\\nPhil is very personable and has much to share about Boston. We had some great conversations. \\n\\nI'd certainly stay here again when work brings me back to Boston. Room is very clean, space is adequate, host is very entertaining and welcoming, nice neighborhood, would definitely come backPhil was an excellent host. The room and apartment were well appointed and very comfortable. I very much enjoyed chatting with Phil about his travels and day to day life and his expertise about Boston (as a native) was invaluable to my housing search. This was my first Airbnb experience and Phil has set the bar very high. He was also kind and flexible when my plans changed. I would definitely recommend staying with Phil for those headed to Boston, particularly by car, as his street offers ample parking and quick access to local arteries. Phil was a great host, accommodating and friendly without being intrusive. He provides a beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood steps from the arboretum. Great trip.I stayed with Phil for three months over the summer of 2015. Phil provided me with a comfortable room in his pleasant, art-filled apartment. It was a very convenient location for Faulkner Hospital where I was working....a 20 minute walk. Also, the apartment is a handy place for Forest Hills T-station...a nice walk through the Arboretum. Phil is a great host and, in fact, an all-around good bloke.\\n110% recommendation.I was in Boston for a convention and Phil made my stay there super comfortable and friendly. He was very accommodating and helpful - he was quite generous with his time in assisting me with my stay even though he runs his business from home. The room is cozy and clean, with plenty of desk area for when I needed to do some work. Also when he had the time, Phil even gave me a ride to where I needed to go (I didn't have a car and mostly took the bus/train) and he was very kind to offer me a few home-cooked meals though I mostly ate out at nearby restaurants. His house is beautifully decorated with lots of folk art and I enjoyed hearing his travel and life stories. He has great information and tips on the local sights and dining options as well as commute options.Phil was a delightful host. I found his 1920's era house very appealing.  And I enjoyed our conversations, and hearing about his travel adventures.\\nThe bedroom was perfect for me: pleasantly arranged with a very comfortable bed, with a large desk that I wish I had an opportunity to use. The room was conveniently next to both the bathroom and kitchen. I felt very comfortable and at home at Phil's place.Phil was a wonderful host. He was flexible with check in time, and was highly accommodating to us, letting us borrow his umbrella when it as pouring, among other things. I would definitely stay with Phil again. Phil is a very nice man and a welcoming host. Room and amenities were as described in the post. Good, quiet location with plenty of parking available. I enjoyed staying here.  The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable.  Phil's apartment is within walking distance of great park trails and the Arboretum.  Another great stay at Phil's place.  When we arrived, Phil picked us up at the Forest Hills Station of Orange Line by MBTA. \\n\\nPhil's hospitality, patience, generority, and thoughtful consideration just made us feel at home!\\n\\n Moreover, heartfelt gratitude for Phil to invite me to  Phil's family parties. Because it made my dreams of knowing your American folks life style come true!\\n\\nFor more information, as a supplement to Phil's statement, there is a Chinese Restaurant (Hong Kong 888) round the corner!\\n\\nLooking forward to staying at Phil's house again.Phil's place is well appointed and in a very nice neighborhood. There is a convenience store and a few restaurants around the corner and Roslindale Village is about a fifteen minute walk away. Getting to/from downtown Boston can take a bit of time especially during the evening or Sunday's when buses run less frequently so make sure to leave plenty of time if you have appointments there. Overall the neighborhood is very charming and Phil is great host, he's a great source of information and very responsive to any questions you may have during your stay. \"]\n",

      "  'We stayed for two nights last week, and we had an absolutely lovely experience. Her home is beautiful, inviting, and cozy, and extremely well-located a few blocks from downtown. She was very friendly and welcoming, and we felt at home right away. We very much hope to return to this lovely place!Linda is a Nice host. Good communication and helpful. The house is cozy and clean. The neighborhood is nice, safe and quiet. Bus stop is nearby and it takes around 45mins to downtown. I would stay there again.Linda was very welcoming and helpful when we arrived. The house and room were just as they had been described and very comfortable and spotlessly clean! Linda has posted brief notes in the room, bathroom and kitchen so it was easy to figure out things like towels and breakfast. \\nStaying with Linda was my first time with an airb&b place, and I will certainly be returning to her place the next time I visit my friend in Roalindale (whose house was an easy five minute walk away).  I strolled back and forth several times even late in the evening safely and comfortably.Parking on the street also turned out to be trouble free.Linda was perfect host. She has very clean house, this fact shows her respect for her guests.  I really appriciate comfortable bed in Linda\\'s house. When I was in there I was really feeling like I would have been at home.We had a wonderful stay at Linda\\'s Home. Very clean and comfy. Everything is made easy for you to respect her home. Linda was very accomodating although we arrived very late the first day, due to some traffic and border crossing. Very easy access to the city center thanks to a pass Linda leaves at disposal for her guests. We were able to leave our car in the street outside in a completely safe neighbourhood, which was perfect. All in all, a perfect stay thanks to Linda\\'s nice attentions.Linda was a wonderful host! She has everything so delightfully organized in\\n such a way that you feel very welcome in her home. She is close enough to downtown to make it easily accessible to everything and far enough that you can park on the street with no problem and feel safe. This home is just how a airbnb should be. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Linda is a wonderful host - she was fast to respond, super friendly and very informative. I appreciated her flexibility with a late arrival. She was so welcoming and checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly. Her home was very comfortable and exactly as described. The area is lovely, a quiet neighborhood close to transportation with easy access to downtown Boston. Linda even had a metro pass to make things easy. The room was just as it looks (even better, actually!)- sunny, cozy and very comfortable. This was a wonderful space to come back to after long days. It immediately felt like home away from home. I would definitely stay here again.Lovely neighbourhood. Very clean, neat tidy house. Would happily stay again.Linda was wonderfully welcoming, helpful and caring. She made us feel right at home. She\\'s a short walk from the village which has every thing you need including a fantastic cheese shop.Spotless home with very cozy room!LInda could not have been more accomodating!  She helped us with train and bus information (even providing a Charlie Card - which saved us time).  The neighborhood is lovely and we had no problem finding her location.  Room is exactly as described and the mattress was fabulous!  Her home is exactly what we were looking for, very clean, and we would definitely stay with her again on our next trip to the Boston area.  Linda is a fabulous hostess and did a great job of welcoming us as her guests and making us comfortable.  My daughter and I had a wonderful week together touring Boston and staying in a home setting rather than a cold impersonal hotel.  The bus line is very close and convenient and the train lines make getting around simple without renting a car.  Double thumbs up for this experience with AirBnB.  Thanks Linda!Linda is so welcoming! She went out of her way to make sure my mom and I felt comfortable during our stay. She is so laid back, and has such a gentle personality. The listing was absolutely as described, the neighborhood was safe and quiet, and the accommodations were beautiful. We shared a bathroom with other guests, but the bathroom is very large, and everyone is respectful of each other\\'s space and schedule. It was never awkward at all. Such a warm, friendly atmosphere all through the house. Also, Linda makes some killer carrot breakfast muffins! I definitely recommend staying with her, and would stay again myself! Thank you, Linda!Linda made my family feel very welcome and her house was very comfortable.  She had delicious muffins and coffee for us in the morning!  Highly recommend.  La casa de Linda está muy bien ubicada, cerca de las lineas de autobús. Ella se portó muy bien con nosotros y nos explicó como usar el transporte en Boston. El cuarto era muy limpio y cómodo. Recomiendo ampliamente alojarse con ellam fue una bonita experiencia.Linda was a charming and gracious host who made my visit feel like I was coming home to visit a family member. I had come to run the Boston marathon, and Linda even came to cheer me and the woman I came with on. She was excited for us to have finished as if we had been one of her family members. The room we stayed in was nicer than the photos, the beds are comfy, her place was impeccably clean and with lovely duvets. We had ample towels, hot water,  and great coffee. Having a door with a digicode is a real plus- so simple to use, and we really appreciated her having given us a metro pass to use. In short, a highly recommended places to stay with a warm and welcoming host. Linda\\'s home was as beautiful as pictured. She was a gracious hostess and provided  a lovely  breakfast. She went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and comfortable in her home. The location was near the bus stop going to the train station and into downtown.

Linda  and her roommates are all so nice and make us feel at home.  What we feel beyond expectation is the breakfast.  Linda prepared many kinds of breads, fruits and there is also juice, milk, almond milk, yogurt for your choice.  You can have eggs with butter for your toast too.  When you are busy traveling, these breakfast things make your life much easier and healthier.  \\nWe also get a lot of helpful information from the host and her roommates. It is a wonderful experience to stay there.  Linda made us feel welcome and made sure we felt at home. She gave us a Charlie Card and transportation map to use.

My son and I want to say \"thank you\" for ALL to our hospitable Linda and say \"thank you\" to her comfy and cozy home:)We had some really great days at Linda\\'s house! There is absolutely nothing we could criticise - quiet and clean rooms, comfortable beds and such a friendly, open-minded and lovely host! Recomendation: 100%.La maison de Linda est extrêmement confortable, propre, et dans un environnement résidentiel calme et plein de charme. Nous avons été ravies de partager la cuisine avec les deux locataires qui vivent à l\\'année dans cette grande maison. Comme Linda était partie camper ce sont ces deux jeunes locataires qui nous ont accueillies et qui nous ont aidées à nous installer. Elles ont été de précieuses ambassadrices et nous les en remercions. Nous avons trouvé à quelques centaines de mètres de la maison deux épiceries et un petit resto chinois très sympa. Le seul inconvénient c\\'est la distance de la maison au Downtown : Linda nous avait procuré deux cartes Charlie pour les déplacements en bus et train. Nous les avons utilisés mais aussi nous avons utilisé Uber beaucoup plus rapide et moins cher que les taxis. Globalement très satisfaites de notre séjour, nous recommandons vivement la maison de Linda.The property was as described and was very comfortable. Linda\\'s communication was excellent and everyone was very welcoming. The house itself was very clean and tidy - we really enjoyed our stay!Linda a été très acceuillante malgré mon retard sur le plan prévu. Elle m\\'a transmis toutes les informations nécessaires et même plus, notamment les transports en ville. La maison est d\\'une tranquillité et d\\'une propreté exemplaire. Lit confortable. Le transport public est facile d\\'accès et à proximité. Ma prochaine visite à Boston sera chez Linda assurément.Linda was a great host. She responded very quiclkly and was very kind. She made us feel like we were home. She provided everything we needed for our stay and more. The house is beautiful, super clean, close to restaurants and public transportation. I would definitely stay here againz People are all very nice here, Linda\\'s a very good host and she even provided us Charlie cards. The view outside is beautiful and the house is very near to the bus station.It\\'s all in the little details. She made sure we had shower caddies and left us notes upon our arrival.Linda was warm and hospitable. Her house was very nice, comfortable and extremely clean which I appreciate very much. The neighborhood is safe and quiet and parking is no problem. She is super responsive with email and msg and is very organized and helpful. What more would anyone want? I recommend staying at Linda\\'s. ']]\n",

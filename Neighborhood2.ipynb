Matthew was very fastidious about every detail--he had toiletries there just in case, provided lovely folded clean towels, the whole apartment was immaculate, and he even gave us treats for our two dogs just as a nice gesture. He allowed us to use his laundry detergent to do a load of laundry while we stayed, and he made us feel very welcome in his home. We highly recommend both the host and the digs!Matt met us for check-in and walked through the apartment with us. Everything looked exactly like the pictures. He's been to alot of concerts and the place is decorated with several posters. Kitchen was updated and perfect for making breakfast. Bathrooms were clean. Clean apartment, Matt did a fine job in ensuring all things for a comfortable stay are available.Bed is super comfy. This is a roomy place, I would stay here again! Matt was very responsive, and has great taste in wine!Matt's apartment is perfect for those traveling with a dog and need a comfortable place to stay in Boston.  The location is great with amenities nearby and quick access to major highways.\\n\\nThe apartment itself is very dog friendly and Matt was great about thinking of our dogs upon arrival (he had a bag of treats for them).  The flooring is dog appropriate and the complex itself has some good grassy areas for them.  The neighborhood is walkable with dogs.\\n\\nThe apartment is nicely furnished with the basics and the internet connection is great.  Parking was available upon request.  Matt was communicative and responsive during our 1-week stay.\\n\\nHighly recommend!\\n\\n For someone that lived in Boston for over a decade this is as good as it gets - great transaction and excellent location. It was a pleasure to stay here. Matt is very organised and was very accommodating despite my very late arrival. The apartment itself is very cosy and clean with plenty of space for a solo traveller or a couple. And it has all the facilities that one would need. The area is also pretty good. Highly recommend it!Great and comfortable apartment is a nice neighborhood. Swimming pool just across the street, great for a morning swim! Matt is a lovely host, good communication and very welcoming. Would certainly recommend!Excellent place to stay in the Brighton area.  Matt was an excellent host and made sure our stay was everything we  expected, would use again without question.I stayed at Matt's for a week while my house was house's ceiling was being repaired. Matt was very responsive and flexible in setting up the key exchange and providing info about the apartment. Very nice and clean apartment, worked great for my week's stay.Matt was a well-prepared and welcoming host.  He had a 4-page info sheet that anticipated most of our questions.

In my free time I do a lot of sports: triathlon, skiing, rowing,... what is perfect to do in Boston. Apart from that I love to travel (Europe, Southern and Northern America and South- East Africa...), meeting new people, read and go to the theater or ballet. I used airbnb before with a friend who also has an account here and loved it. I think it is such a great idea, so that is why I now created my own account :-). When I travel I like to have a clean and quite place to relax and to explore the city. I think airbnb is a great opportunity to rent a place and to explore the city not from a tourist point of view but also to see some local sides :-).'\n",
      "  'Apartment was as advertised and the host was both communicative and helpful.   A nice alternative to a hotel and close to pretty much everything you need.  The neighborhood is very nice, right on the T line, restaurants close by. The studio is small, clean and very pleasant. If you have a car, consider another neighborhood - there is absolutely no parking anywhere. Very nice and comfortable apt. Close to T train. Feels like home. \\nSofa bed was good but real bed would be better Katharina was very responsive when we had questions and Maureen was accommodating for our late arrival. The studio was nice and clean and everything we needed for our long weekend in Boston. It is a bonus that it was so close to 3 different trains on the green line, making it easy to see different parts of the city. A great experience for our first time using AirBnB.\\nThis studio was perfect for my stay in Boston. It was nice, in a good neighborhood, comfortable and near BC which is what I needed for my trip. Easy access to public transportation. The building is older and does have the normal sounds you\\'d expect from neighbors all around (hearing them walk above you), but no loud music or anything like that. The bed is a sofa bed so it\\'s not the most comfortable but perfectly acceptable for a short stay. Katharina was easily contacted as was her MIL Maureen who was especially helpful. She made other arrangements for me specifically when we realized my short self wouldn\\'t be able to access where the keys are normally kept and I really appreciated that. I would definitely stay there again if I come back to Boston!Great neighborhood and location next to the T (B Line).  The apartment was just as described and was very comfortable with a delightful atmosphere that was most welcoming. Katharina was very quick to respond to messages and easy to work with.  The unit is cozy yet bright and has everything one might need and especially enjoyed the little kitchen.  Overall, staying here was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to others.  Such a lovely place to stay, and it was super convenient being so close to Boston College! I could definitely see myself coming back here should I find myself once again in the Chestnut Hill area. Katharina and Maureen were fantastic. Muareen even made sure there was coffee available for me for the duration I my stay. Overall, the place wa exactly as described and worked perfect for my needs. It is so close to the trains for getting around town. The neighborhood around the receiver is beautiful. The building is older and is quite nice. The age of the building does make carryover noise from the other units noticeable but completely tolerable. There street noise can be a bit loud but that is to be expected in the city. Also, the bed is pullout sofa  but it was comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and would be happy to stay here again. Perfect for a single traveler or couple. Katharina and Maureen were very welcoming and easy to deal with, prompt and helpful. Bottled water and bananas were a nice extra touch. The apartment is not beautiful, really, but it is comfortable, quiet, safe, private -- everything I could have wanted for a weekend in Boston. The sofabed is modern, with no bar across the backside; I slept well there. And the location can\\'t be beat, with a T stop on the block, shops nearby and Zipcars handy.Nice apartment on the 3rd floor over Commonwealth ave. A good location, with a  convenient and pleasant to walk to Boston College. Also very convenient for  the Green line (B, C and D) for getting into Boston.My parent\\'s stay at Katherina\\'s place was great. Katherina\\'s mother in law was very helpful and responsive. The bed was not the most comfortable but that was expected since I knew it would be a pullout couch. The location is great and near BC and the T lines.nettes kleines Appartement, schön gelegen direkt an einem See, der zum sich zum Joggen eignet. Es sind drei Linien der \"Green Line\" zu Fuß erreichbar, die einen in die Innenstadt bringen. Ein richtiges Bett wäre besser, für ein paar Tage geht es aber auf der Schlafcouch. Etwas hellhörig und der Lärm der Straße ist relativ laut, allerdings ist in der Nacht kaum Verkehr.Communication was great and the location was perfect - steps from the B and C line, and great if you want to go around Boston College and the Chestnut Hill Reservoir.This is a confortable studio in a very nice neighbourhood. The kitchen was very well equipped, with coffee machine, toaster, oven, microwave, etc, which was really convenient.\\n\\nIt was a great experience.Good studio with separate kitchen and bathroom and comfortable fold-down bed - just as described. Maureen was very helpful indeed - going so far as to stand in a parking space outside while I drove round the block! A bit of traffic noise, but no more than might be expected given the location. Nice neighbourhood. Cleveland Circle is only 10 minutes walk away with convenience stores, restaurants and an alternative access to a different (and shorter) line of the T.  We\\'d go back. Nice apartment with good coneection to the public transportstion.Apartment was great. Just minutes from a train station and in a good location. Hosts were really easy to get in contact with.Our host was great and very helpful whenever we needed anything, and even stayed up past midnight to help us move in. Place was clean and comfortable. Overall, very nice stay!Well located with access to 3x Green T lines. The A/C proved to be essential as Summer high temperatures were reached. Bonus fresh coffee was grinned for our mornings.'\n",

      "  'Erin and J.D. were fantastic! They welcomed us at the door (as well as Lexi and Millie, their dogs). They showed us our room and around their lovely home.\\n\\nThe bedroom was as big as advertised with a great bed, fresh linens, and awesome basket of goodies and essentials. \\n\\nThey were great about giving directions and suggesting places to visit. J.D. even went out of his away to reserve us discounted tickets at the MFA.\\n\\nEverything about our stay was great. They really took care of us. \\n\\nThanks Erin and J.D.! Great place to stay ! Erin is an amazing host, extremely nice and helpful, who like to meet new people. We really enjoy our stay in this charming house, well decorated, really quiet and in a nice area. The two dogs (Lexie and Millie) are really nice too.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we found a welcome pack with snacks, water, soap, shampoo... Our room was big enough, cosy and confortable. The house is closed to bus station (about 5 minutes walk) to Boston center.\\n\\nWe would definitely recommend this place to everyone, big thanks !\\nErin and JD are wonderful folks, with  very relaxed, helpful and kind attitudes.  Their 2 dogs also were great host, they are very affectionate and attached to their owners :) \\n\\nI felt as though JD and Erin went above and beyond to help me out as I was moving to the Boston area, making references to neighborhoods and calling people they know.... JD even dropped me off to a location that I needed to visit.\\n\\nThey even give you a few goodies that you may or may not need/use in your room like soap, mints, bottle water, a snack bar, etc.\\nNeighborhood: The neighborhood is quiet, yet very accessible and easy to get around, with everything you need within a few blocks.Couldn\\'t have asked for a better way to start my transition to Boston! Erin and JD immediately made me feel right at home, we\\'re very easy to communicate with, and the dogs were friendly and extremely well-behaved. The room itself is comfortable, clean and quiet, and the house is less than a ten minute walk to restaurants, stores, coffee shops and public transportation. I would absolutely recommend staying here if you want to meet truly great people and explore a nice neighborhood in Boston!I can\\'t thank Erin and JD enough for being amazing hosts. I was living in Boston prior to my stay with them they were definitely one of the highlights of my last days in the city. Both were extremely helpful with my situation (moving out of the country), they were always extremely nice and just great to hang out! we almost immediately became friends. They even let me store some luggage a few days prior to my stay with them to facilitate my move. Also, Lexie and Millie (their dogs) are extremely adorable and well behaved, which made my stay that much more pleasant.\\n\\nI can\\'t recommend these guys enough for your stay, and I know that the second I\\'m back in Boston they will definitely be my first choice.Erin and her husband are extremely friendly and kind. The house and room are lovely, comfortable and welcoming. (They even prepared many small but thoughtful items for us! Thank you!) The neighborhood is quiet and close to the shops and restaurant; easy free street parking is a big plus. Strongly recommend to whoever is looking for a nice and friendly place to stay, especially if you love dogs!! They are very well behaved and CUTE!  \\n\\nThank you for making our trip in Boston such a wonderful experience!Erin & JD were terrific hosts. Very helpful w/ transportation issues and even gave me a CharlieCard to get around town. Loved the dogs.too!Erin was incredible nice and very helpful! Thank you very much!!!Erin and JD are amazing hosts! We\\'ve been like at home, the room was spacious and clean and they provided us with a lot of selfcare stuff and city information. The house is so nice and so is the neighborhood, in just 20 minutes you arrive to Kenmore, Fenway or Commonwealth avenue! It\\'s the perfect place to stay for a visit to Boston!staying here was amazing!!! erin & jd were both super friendly and helpful, especially when it came to using the local public transportation (jd generously lent us his charliecard). the house was roomy and clean, smelled fresh, and our room was perfect. we were supplied a nice basket of assorted amenities (soaps, snacks, water, toothbrushes, mints, etc.) which was really sweet. \\n\\nhanging out at the house with them was like hanging out with old friends. we kicked back each night for a couple of hours chatting while playing with their 2 wonderful dogs, lexi & millie. very laid-back atmosphere, which was nice.\\n\\ntheir home is really conveniently located near lots of shops and restaurants, and most importantly for anyone wanting to venture into boston, close to lots of bus stops! \\n\\neven though we only stayed for two nights, we felt super spoiled and really had an awesome time. would absolutely recommend erin & jd for anyone heading into the boston area!!Ruthie and I really enjoyed being at Erin and JD\\'s home.  They are warm and gracious and treated us like friends and not like renters.  The room is a nice size and all sorts of unexpected amenities were put out.  The home is in a great neighborhood, easy accessibility to downtown Boston and also near the river for a nice morning run.  We would definitely stay with them again if we find ourselves in the Boston area.  I highly recommend them.We had a great stay!   The room was clean and comfy and the bed was cozy.  Erin and JD are very warm and friendly, and as are their fabulous dogs, Lexi and Millie.  Our hosts offered lots of helpful information and welcomed us to use what we needed in the kitchen. The house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood away from the busy downtown hub.  We had to take both bus and train to get downtown, but that was a fun adventure once we found the bus stops.  Bottom line:  staying at \"Must Love Dogs\" feels like you are visiting friends and we\\'d do it again in a heartbeat.It was my first time to use airbnb site, and it was awesome!Erin and JD were so nice and kind! They prepared all things for us when staying there; i was so impressed that they prepared first aid kit, shampoos and towels, and even cereal bar:). It was easy to find their house, too. I strongly recommend you to choose Erin\\'s place. Erin, and JD, Thank you so much for your kindness and help. Fredi and i want you to meet many good guests and fill your maps successfully. Our stay was very comfortable and convenient.  We were able to walk to several places to eat and drink and using public transportation to get around was also a breeze (with (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps app).  Erin was a very welcoming host and provided nothing but the best hospitality.  I recommend Erin\\'s place and would stay here again.I wish we had had more time to spend in Boston. After a week long bicycle tour throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire we needed a place to stay before we had to get back to New York. A simple bed would have been enough. Instead we got Erins place - Jackpot! Not only did we get a warm welcome from JD who showed us around, our room was nice and clean, with a comfortable bed and fresh towels (you have no idea how great this is after one week \"on the road\"). And like in a 5 star hotel we were provided with a basket full of snacks, toiletries and water. The next morning, when we tried to leave without waking anybody up (we didn\\'t do so well) JD - still with ruffled hair - came to wave us goodbye. One great AirBnB experience and we highly recommend these guys who are perfect hosts!Erin and JD were incredibly welcoming, inviting us into their home and made sure we had everything that we needed during our time there.  Their dogs, too, are incredibly sweet and well-behaved.\\n\\nThe house is in a fantastic location.  It\\'s within shooting distance of the city center and several restaurants and cafés are just up the street.  I would definitely recommend it for a short-term stay!While our stay was very short, we had a great experience! Erin was very accomodating to our late arrival, and even stayed up to give us a tour and make us feel very much at home. \\n\\nOur room was beautifully appointed and included amenities like complimentary water, snacks, and toiletries. \\n\\nThe bed was SUPER comfy! Probably even more so than some hotels I\\'ve stayed at! \\n\\nErin\\'s pups are very well behaved and totally cute - definitely brightened up my evening to meet them.  \\n\\nThanks for everything, Erin!The entire experience was perfect. Staying with Erin and JD was like staying with family ( the good kind of family).  They are the nicest people and it was is if I knew them for years.  The accommodations were exactly as shown, clean and comfortable.  Additionally, their neighborhood is very quiet so if you\\'re a light sleeper, it doesn\\'t get better than this.  I\\'m would definitely stay with them again. Staying with Erin and JD was like staying with old friends! These two are an absolute blast, and their two dogs are such sweethearts. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived! The room is a great size, with such a comfortable bed - it was our best night of sleep the entire week we were in Boston. The house is cozy and E&J have made sure to accommodate you with maps, goodies, toiletries, etc. Make sure to put your pin on their world map showing where you\\'re from. Their home is in a wonderful location - a quick stroll to downtown Brighton (make sure you stop at Mandy and Joe\\'s for breakfast), with a mini-mart just down the street for any last minute needs. We definitely recommend booking here and know next time we\\'re in town, we\\'ve got a great place to stay!I really felt like I was home at Erin\\'s place :) Erin and JD was so kind and accommodating. Also, the bed was so comfy that I didn\\'t want to wake up every morning. The location is near the bus stop so I could get to central easily :) \\nAnd their dogs; Lexi and millie, were so cute!\\nI was so lucky that I could stay at Erin\\'s place!\\nThank you. Erin and JD were awesome hosts. The room was very clean and had anything we needed to enjoy a mini vacation in Boston. Their neighborhood is easily one of the best places to go out for a drink and some great food, but even though we didn\\'t get the chance, judging from the short time we did spend together, staying in and hanging out with Erin, JD, Lexi and Millie would have been a lot of fun! \\nThe house was very clean and their dogs, very friendly. I hope the next time I\\'m Boston bound they have a room available.It was a great experience with Erin and JD, they have two lovely dogs and gave us some tips on training our new puppy. We have our own private room and it was comfy and clean. This was my first Airbnb experience and Erin was the best host I could ask for. The room was comfy and clean and everything was just so homey. They have two great and well trained dogs that made the stay even better for me and my dog. Erin even made a little bed for my dog right next to my bed which I thought was a very nice tough. 10 out of 10!We had a wonderful stay at Erin and JD\\'s the bedroom was very clean and comfortable.  Great location it was close to everything. Erin and JD were great, we will definitely use them again when we are in town.Excellent Airbnb. Ma conjointe et moi le recommandons. Le quartier est tranquille et il comporte plusieurs petits restaurants sympathiques. De la maison de Erin et JD, il est possible d’avoir accès au système de Bus amenant vers Harvard ou le centre-ville de Boston. Les hôtes nous ont fourni une carte de bus/métro afin de faciliter nos déplacements. Nous avions accès à tout dans la maison (cuisine, salle de bain, frigidaire, …). Merci !\\n\\nThis Airbnb is really great, my wife and I recommend this place. The hosts were really helpful (they give us a bus/T card) and friendly (we took a good IPA beer when we arrived with Erin et JD). We had access to everything in the house. We share the place with the host and they respected our privacy and were really quiet. \\n\\nThanks Erin et JD!\\n\\nAlex and Jay\\nAbout the Home:\\nThe house is located in a nice calm locality in a beautiful area. It just 2 minutes to the bus station and a few minutes to the T station.  Lots of restaurants, shops and pubs are just a short walk. Street Parking is freely available.\\nThe house is cute, its simple and elegant. The bed is super comfy!!  Its super clean and nice and cozy!\\nThey have a nice basket will all the small nick and nacks and stuff which was really very nice!\\nThe idea of pinning where you came from on the map where you came from was super cool!!\\nAbout the Hosts:\\nErin and JD are one of the nicest people I\\'ve ever met.\\nThey are a lovely family with the cutest set of dogs Lexi & Mili.\\n\\nThey made sure that we were comfortable at their place; they went out of the way to make sure we were comfortable. One night I decided to crash on the couch instead of the bedroom one night they were so sweet before I got out of the room, the couch was already laid down with sheets and pillows.\\n\\nTheir place has felt like home and didn’t feel like you were at an Airbnb!\\n\\nChatting up with them was like catching up with old friends. It didn’t feel like we just knew them from 2 days. We spent like several hours chatting up without realizing where time flew. It was the best evenings we had in Boston.\\n\\nIt might sound cheesy but thanks for making my trip memorable and all the very best to both of you!\\n\\nThank you for making us feel like home and Erin u are like the best hosts ever!!Both Erin & JD were so welcoming to their lovely house and so helpful with directions and things to do.\\n\\nThe bedroom was great and the bed was fantastic . \\n\\nBest shower to date\\n\\nKevin and Marina\\nWe had a great time. Very friendly and helpful hosts. And the dogs are super cute.Erin was so kind to make the room available to me on a last-minute basis, and didn\\'t mind my terribly late (or early morning as it may be) arrival. JD was even still up when I arrived.\\nThe house was nice, the dogs were charming, and the room fantastic. Think: super comfortable bed, cozy sheets, a privacy lock, and a care basket should you need kleenex, for example.\\nMy only complaint was that I didn\\'t get enough time with the dogs. And, about those dogs: The little one was very social, the bigger one was talkative when I arrived, then disinterested after a good sniff of my bags. Also, if you are ambivalent about dogs know that they won\\'t give you a second look if you\\'re in the house when Erin isn\\'t. (Next time, I\\'m bringing doggy treats for bribery.)\\nGreat first AirBnB experience. The location of this house was perfect for a meeting we had at WGBH and Erin and JD\\'s hospitality elevated the experience. Nice attention to detail in the guest room and throughout the house.  Appreciated the easy street parking and local pubs which added to the authentic Brighton experience. Erin and JD are some of the most welcoming, congenial, and accommodating people I have ever met. They are knowledgeable about the area, helped me navigate the MBTA, suggested locations at which to eat, and made me feel all-around welcome in their home. Lexi and Millie, too, are friendly and playful. The listing description is accurate, the room comfortable, and the location excellent. I will definitely stay with them again if I head to Boston. Erin and J.D. were incredible hosts.  This was my first time using an Airbnb & I could not have envisioned a more pleasant experience.  If I am in need of a room again in the Boston area, I would definitely check their abvailiblitity first.  There was ample parking right outside, the house was easy to find, the room (and whole house) was fresh and clean. Their dogs were amazingly well behaved.\\nI also enjoyed Erin and J.D\\'s company - I had been in the car for 6 hours driving from NYC to Boston - traffic was horrible - I was greeted with a smile and a glass of wine.  I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone to stay at \"Must Love Dogs\"!!!!\\nThanks Erin & J.D.!!!Erin and JD\\'s place was the perfect place for me to crash.... Oh, and my dog loved it too!  Their place is lovely, the bedroom was really comfortable, and they are personable and gracious.  They welcomed me with a glass of wine and a lively conversation, and their two awesome dogs welcomed my dog with their favorite couch!  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.Erin was an extremely gracious host.  The room was spacious and had plenty of storage for all of our luggage and clothing.  We weren\\'t at the home much, but we\\'re thankful that we could come in after a long day and get straight to rest!  Room was comfy and the house was clean!Erin and JD and the pups were wonderfully accommodating. We had a great, albeit short, visit to Boston with a perfect stay at their home. Highly recommended!!Erin and J.D. are so nice. House is in great location. Just few minutes walk to bus. House is clean and comfortable. Lexi and Millie are sooooo cute. I would like to stay here when I visit Boston next time.My fiancé and I may have only stayed with JD and Erin for one night, but it was a great stay. After a long day exploring in Boston, their home was warm and welcoming to come back to. Both JD and Erin were quick to respond to texts and messages, friendly and helpful upon arrival, and gave us plenty of space to spend time with each other. The room we stayed in was beautiful; the bed was heavenly. With all of the little thoughtful amenities they provided (Chewy bars, maps, big fluffy towels, UNO, etc.), it felt just like staying at a hotel but with the company of two adorable well-behaved dogs as well. The location may be a little from the main city area but was within walking distance of the buses and the neighborhood was beautiful and felt very safe. All in all, it was well worth the price and we had a great stay!I had a lot of bags with me, and I wanted to check in a bit earlier. Erin was totally accommodating and allowed me to check into the space two hours before. Such a wonderful home, and their dogs are so friendly.This was our first time in a \"shared\" space (not renting an entire apt or home), and it was great! Erin and JD are friendly, accommodating hosts, and their dogs are easy-going. This was the perfect home-base for our wknd trip to Boston. Erin and JD were the best hosts that any first time AirBnB users could\\'ve asked for! Both were welcoming and down to earth. They were super knowledgeable about the points of interests in the city and gave us great recommendations of where to go, what to eat, how to get around, etc. Their house was very clean and the room was just as advertised. Their awesome dogs were well behaved and very friendly. My husband and I would absolutely stay with them again if/when we make it back to Boston.Erin was flexible about the move-in time, gave us very helpful dining out tips, and the room included little extras to make us feel welcome, like granola bars.  The dogs are very nice and well-behaved.  A positive experience overall.  Thanks!Great location in quiet neighborhood, Erin & JD were great - very nice, friendly, laid-back...and dogs are cute! Would stay again.Erin & Jd were lovely hosts the house was in a nice quiet neighbourhood and the bus to Kenmore station which was essential for the greenline subway which gets you everywhere you need to go the dogs were great and well behaved and lexi loves ball games it was a brilliant finish to our 3 month tour of the states and if we go to Boston again we will certainly look Erin upErin is a friendly, laid-back host. I had a great stay in her place and would stay here again. She was very helpful in providing advice on public transit. The bed is also very comfortable. Thanks, Erin!This was our 1st Airbnb experience & it was great. We arrived in Boston on a Wednesday evening greeted by Erin & the \"girls\".  The room and house were clean & friendly. Erin was  helpful, easy going, and we felt welcomed. We loved the little amenities she had in the room - maps, snacks, guest book, etc.  The location was great with free off street parking & a short walk to the bus. A great experience. Thank you Erin, JD, & The girls. Were made to feel very welcome from Erin, JD and their beautiful dogs Millie and Lexie. Beautiful home with easy transport to anywhere in Boston. Very comfortable room and an amazing shower. Would of loved to of stayed longer and would happily go back again. Perfect stay! Erin & JD\\nwere very accomodating and their two dogs well behaved and friendly. Comfy and clean place to stay--could not ask for a better location to Boston and the neighborhood was quiet and easy to navigate around. We plan to stay again and recommend to anyone we know coming to Boston! Erin was a welcoming host. We only spent one night and her lovely home. But instantly felt at home. Our room was clean quiet and comfortable. Even though it was a brief visit, a nice example of how the sharing economy of air B&B maybe helping to reconnect us in ways that profit only accommodations never will. Thanks Erin best of luck to you and JD in the future.Erin and J.D. were both wonderful hosts! We are really happy we chose their house to stay at while visiting Boston! We especially love their two dogs! We hope to go back to Boston soon and definitely stay at their house again!We enjoyed the nicest welcome after the longest travelling day from Erin and Lexi and Millie. Sadly we were unable to meet JD (but left him some Reece\\'s Pieces). Wished we had been able to stay longer in this house, a comfortable haven with wonderful hosts. We\\'d recommend this for anyone staying in Boston. Location is convenient for all transport options, in an area with plenty of choice for great food and drink - we lived Devlins, five mins away...\\n\\nGreat room and location.  Free parking in front, and far enough out you don\\'t have to fight that much traffic!  Really close to bus stop and easy to get downtown.  Erin was very accommodating as we showed up early and she had no problem letting us leave our bags and head downtown.  The dogs are adorable and very friendly.  The bed was very comfy.  Overall we would stay here again in a heartbeat.Erin & J.D. were very gracious hosts and the dogs were so loveable. I absolutely loved my stay.  My room was perfect with an exceptionally comfy bed, dresser, full-length mirror, thick plush towels and an awesome shower with great pressure, and a unit a/c in the bedroom which was great because the temps were in the 90\\'s during my stay !  My hosts were very accommodating, easy going, and extremely friendly.  The bottle water, snacks, first aid kit, etc. was also a nice touch.\\nTheir home is located on a quiet residential street with plenty of parking right in front of the house, which can be hard to come by in this area.  \\nI would definitely recommend staying at Must Love Dogs!!Our host Erin - and her two well behaved canine pals - were very hospitable and accommodating.  She was particularly patient, kind and helpful throughout - especially when we got lost (we don’t have GPS), staying on the phone with us while we made our way to her house.   Her home and the room that we stayed in, were quite comfortable.   There was easy parking, well functioning air conditioning  both in the room and common space (it was hot outside), great shower pressure and lots of little luxuries such as plush towels.  All in all, a very pleasant experience - exactly as advertised.  For my next trip to the area, I\\'ll certainly check on her availabilityErin, absente avant notre arrivée, nous a confié sa maison comme si nous nous connaissions depuis longtemps. Accueillis par ses deux adorables chiennes, nous avons pu prendre possession de notre chambre en toute quiétude. Le quartier très calme et le moment passé avec Erin sur la petite terrasse est un excellent souvenir. Nous avons apprécié toutes les attentions d\\'Erin pour que notre nuit passée dans sa maison soit des plus agréables. Erin nous a parlé avec passion de cette charmante vieille bâtisse qui est des plus chaleureuse. Merci Erin, à notre prochain séjour à Boston nous resterons plus longtemps dans ta maison.My daughter and I had a very enjoyable overnight stay -- our first Airbnb experience -- with Erin and her lovable dogs.  She couldn\\'t have been more welcoming and easy to be around.  Her dogs were very friendly and one of them does an amazing trick!  The accommodations were very clean, totally comfortable and convenient to our destination. We will certainly stay again should we return to Boston!\\nWe loved staying with Erin! Everything was perfect. Neighborhood was nice, within walking distance of restaurants and shops. We even saw a rabbit in one of the yards. Erin\\'s house is in an ideal location, close enough to Boston centre for easy travel via public transport but sufficiently out of town for easy and free parking. We received a very warm welcome from Erin and her two lovely dogs. She provided us with plenty of useful information about travelling into Boston centre and really made us feel at home. In case you were wondering, even though there are two dogs in the house, there was no doggy smell!\\n\\nWould definitely recommend.We had a great time with Erin and JD. The house is very clean and her two dogs are well behaved. I brought my friend on Vacation with me and I\\'m really glad that Erin was his first experience with Airbnb. \\n\\nWe really hope to come out and visit again!Je conseil à tous l\\'appartement d\\'Erin. Il est très confortable, chaleureux et le quartier est paisible. \\nDe plus on s\\'y sent comme chez soi. \\nErin met à disposition des documents et des cartes sur ma ville. \\nTrès belle expérience ! It was a pleasure staying with Erin and her pups. Although we flew in late Thursday night, Erin waited for us to arrive and answered all of the questions we had about sites to visit and means of transportation around the city. We enjoyed everything about our stay! When we visit Boston in the future, we will be looking to stay with Erin again. Erin has a wonderful home and did a fantastic job of getting us set up for our first day in Boston. We planned on seeing both downtown Boston and the Harvard campus in our time which made this location the perfect in between. Even though our trip was very short we were glad we chose to stay with Erin for the night. Thanks for everything!! Erin\\'s house was the perfect place to discover Boston and Harvard\\'s campus by train and bus. We enjoyed staying with Erin and she gave us some useful tips on what to do and was very hospitable.The house and room were extremely comfortable and well cared for - the bedding was especially nice. Erin\\'s communication before and during the visit were excellent. She is a very considerate host - highly recommended.Very accommodating and pleasant hosts. Comfortable bed. Good amenities. Clean. Quiet neighborhood, close to good food and shops. Cute dogs. Feel really sorry about checking out 30 minute late\\nBecause we forgot the check out time\\nIt\\'s our fault.\\nBut I don\\'t think we need to be scolded and threatened even when we had left the house\\nIt\\'s really scared us\\n\\nWe had a very nice time staying at Erin\\'s home. The room was set up very nicely and we enjoyed the plush towels as well as the very comfi bed. Their 2 dogs are very well behaved. Erin and JD were awesome hosts!!  Erin was always quick to reply to my messages and answer questions. The room was great!  We enjoyed the snacks and water in the basket and the bed was super comfortable. The world map on the wall was cool, as you could place a pin as to where you were from. It was fun to see where all their visitors had come from. Millie and Lexie are great dogs!!  So fun to stay at a home that has pets. This helps when you miss your own fur babies back home. The location is in a great, safe neighborhood and getting downtown to the tourist sights was pretty easy. I also appreciated that there was parking at their home for my rental car. I definitely recommend staying here!  Nice and comfortable room, lovely neighborhood. We only stayed for one night, but in that short time Erin was very nice and helpful. \\nOne thing - the apartment is not near the airport, so if thats a neccessity, this is not the right place. 位子有點偏遠 但是一間很舒服的房間Erin was welcoming and helpful and even did some laundry for us which was kind. The location is a little further out of town than we realised but public transport is good. The house could do with a lick of paint and looked somewhat worn. The dogs were friendly.Very nice, uncomplicated hosts. The room was very well presented and also very clean. We felt very comfortable there.Nous avons passé un très bon séjour. L\\'accueil était chaleureux, la maison était conforme à la description. Erin et JD sont à l\\'écoute et très arrangeants. L\\'accès au centre ville est facile mais un peu long. Nous recommandons cette maison.Erin, JD and Lexie and Millie were so welcoming! We completely enjoyed and greatly appreciated their hospitality. They were so helpful and overall great hosts. We hope to be able to meet up again with them in the future! I had a great time staying with Erin and JD. They gave us a great dinner recommendation and when we got back we chatted for hours and got to watch the blood moon with them and their neighbors. I truly feel like I have friends to visit in Boston now. Erin and JD were relaxed hosts. We felt very welcome in their home, and appreciated the thoughtful touches and helpful tips. The bed was incredibly comfortable, great shower with the bathroom located right next to the room. Nice suburb with plenty of food options nearby and easy to get to Boston central on the bus and T. Excellent communication.Had a wonderful experience with Erin and JD. Both are very friendly and gave us great recommendations for dinner and sight seeing. The room was comfortable and had everything we needed. Would highly recommend Erin and JD\\'s place for a nice home-away-from-home experience.Erin and JD were awesome. After we arrived in Boston, we decided to stay downtown to walk the Freedom Trail prior to dropping our bags off and Erin was accommodating to our changed schedule. When we finally met, they were very welcoming and shared great insights into the culinary options of their city. After taking JD\\'s excellent advice on a seafood restaurant, we joined them later on that evening in their home for glass of wine and great conversation. The room and bath was clean and we felt like it was home. They made our stay in Boston that much more special. Thank you again.Had a great (though very brief) stay at Erin\\'s place. She and Jeff were very friendly and made me feel very comfortable staying. I felt welcome to mingle as much as I liked, and when I shut my door, they gave me privacy. A great experience all around.La chambre et le lit étaient très confortables. Les hôtes très sympathiques. Je recommande.Ik zal het nogmaals in het Nederlands schrijven.  Dit is gemakkelijker.  De kamer was perfect in orde.  In de kamer was een mandje waarin verzorgingsgerief lag dat we konden gebruiken. Er lagen propere handdoeken.  Ook mapjes over Boston lagen in de kamer.  De douche was zalig.  Erin en JD waren supervriendelijk.  We voelden ons direct thuis. Het is een warm koppel dat mensen direct op hun gemak kan stellen.  Het huis ligt in een veilige en rustige buurt.  We mochten ook vragen stellen over alles van Boston en omgeving.  Ik zou zeker terug gaan naar deze mensen als ik nog eens terug naar Boston zou gaan.\\nHet enige spijtige is dat we op de morgen van vertrek de Erin en JD niet meer gezien hebben om nog afscheid te kunnen nemen.Erin and JD were excellent hosts: very welcoming, helpful and considerate. The place was exactly as described and the dogs were lovely (and stole my dad\\'s heart). The location near Brighton Center worked well for us and the bus takes you downtown easily. Highly recommended!Erin and JD were great hosts. They made my short stay very comfortable and relaxing. The room was nice and clean, everything was as described. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. I would recommend this place to anyone who visits Boston. Thank you very much! I had a great stay at Erin and JD\\'s place. It\\'s a block away from many stores and restaurants in the Brighton area. I was greeted by two lovely dogs and JD was very helpful with giving me suggestions of transportation and stores. I didn\\'t get to meet Erin because we were never at the same place at the same time.  Nonetheless, Erin was my point of contact since I first booked and she made communication very easy between us. I recommend this place to anyone that is in need of a private room and a warm welcome to Boston. My daughter and I came to Boston to watch the Patriots game and it worked out great.  The location is conveniently located off the Mass Pike with free on-street parking.  Erin and JD and their dogs were all very nice us.  They were great hosts.  We didn\\'t get to meet Erin, but she was great over the app. JD was a great host who was flexible, helpful, and fine with quality time or letting you be. The room is an absolute dream and better than a hotel in my opinion, because it has everything and is also secluded and comfortable like home. This listing is such a friendly and beautiful environment that I almost can\\'t believe I stumbled upon it by chance. Erin & JD (and their two kids - the dogs) were everything you could want in AirBNB hosts. They were super friendly to talk to, had a great, inviting home, and are people you can call \"friends\" in a matter of minutes. Furthermore, the dogs were very friendly. I had a great stay and would definitely recommend Erin & JD if you\\'re looking in area!We had a great time staying with Erin and JD, their house was lovely and they made us feel very welcome. They were very relaxed and helpful, the bed was super comfortable and their dogs were great! Would definitely recommend. Thank you both! :)Erin and JD were lovely hosts.  Easy going and super friendly, their dogs were sweet too.  The room was cozy and the bed very comfortable, with the bathroom nearby.   We will totally stay here again if we come back. Thanks guys!Well, we never actually met Erin (we kept missing each other), but we met her wonderful partner, who made us feel very welcome.  And their four-legged friends helped me not miss mine so much! We also appreciated the bus pass with a little change on it that was left for us - very thoughtful, and what a great idea! Erin is a great host! Even before arriving, Erin kept contact and made sure we were going to get in while they were working. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by her lovely dogs and a lovely room. Everything was near and clean. She provided us with towels and all kinds of amenities. We left soon after checking in, and when we came back late at night, there was a lovely note that told us where to get extra blanket if we needed any. She was very thoughtful. Great place to stay!Erin and JD were GREAT!  I mean the place had good reviews so I had pretty high expectations, but they went way above and beyond those.  Their home is very nice and comfortable, and we loved the location.  Erin immediately gave us recommendations of places to grab dinner and had take-out menus for us to go through.  She even offered to cook us a pre-race pasta dinner the night before the Boston Marathon!  The bedroom was very well made up and the bed was SO cozy!  Everything was neat and clean.  Erin also gave us a card for the bus (with money on it!) and told us exactly how to get there and where we would need to get off for our final destination.   \\nWe thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Erin & JD and loved playing with Lexi & Millie (their two doggies).   This was definitely our best Airbnb experience all around!  Erin and JD are wonderful hosts. The location is excellent and there\\'s always on-street parking. The location is close to most major bus lines and there is plenty to do on Washington Street, just two blocks up. Take time to toss the ball to Lexi and give Millie plenty of love. Enjoy some conversation with Erin & JD as they are great people in addition to being wonderful hosts. We were in Boston for a traveling. The house was nice and Erin and JD are very good person to talk to. Erin have given us a metro card that we can use to take the bus and the train, and they also have given us a lot of suggestions on where to visit and where to eat. ']\n",

Richard did a great job with getting the studio ready for us despite our last minute reservations-  we were pleasantly surprised to find everything we could possibly need already waiting... including shampoo/soap, and even wine, bread, cereal, and coffee!! \\n\\nThe neighborhood is quiet and residential, and though the house is a 10 minute walk to the Green line at Harvard Ave, we felt lucky to pass by so many great neighborhood restaurants on the way. There are also a few buses within a few blocks radius.\\n\\nThe studio itself looks newly renovated, and comes well furnished with a fully supplied kitchen. Great for those who prefer a less touristy experience of Boston and don't want to stay at a hotel. \\n\\nSad to say we never crossed paths with Richard during our Sat-Tues stay, but I suppose that just speaks to the privacy and freedom we were able to enjoy.  \\nAbsolutely lovely home! Had the pleasure of staying here after a week-long conference in a sparse university-based dorm room. This was an amazing treat -- a wonderfully comfortable bed, a fully equipped kitchen, a tastefully decorated space: everything you could want to return to after exploring the city for the first time! Barely ran into the hosts but their communication was amazing. They were flexible with quirky arrival times, wonderfully open about their space, and super accommodating. Would definitely HIGHLY recommend!Richard and Victoria are very nice host. They were at the same time very helpful, kind and discrete. The studio was very clean and comfortable. It's 10 minuits walk to green line and 5 minuits walk to a big supermarket. The neighborhood was very quite and safe. We had great time there. Highly recommended.Great place to stay - studio is in excellent condition, good location, and very hospitable hosts. Highly recommended! This Studio has to be in our top 5 vacation stays we have had.  The neighborhood~comfortable to walk both day and night with many beautiful well kept yards, still within easy accessibility to all of Boston and its surrounds.  The Studio~3rd floor walkup, even more comfortable than the neighborhood, everything someone would need for either a short or long term stay.  Victoria and Richard are the epitome of hostess and host, like that perfect waiter who doesn't hover, yet is always there for the smallest of needs!  We will definitely be repeat guests when back in Boston, if this little gem is not booked.The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.Richard was a great host. Everything was prepared perfectly. The studio is in a very good shape. Although it is small, you will find everything you need. If you want to visit Harvard Business School the location is great, in case you are coming to see Boston you might feel a bit peripheral (most taxi drivers did not even know the street ;-))This is a great studio in a nice and quiet neighborhood. The hosts are very welcoming and accessible.  5 stars!Richard and Victoria were great hosts! We had trouble finding a place to stay in Boston at the last minute, but their studio on Royal Street saved the day. The location was incredible, very close to Harvard Ave and Cambridge Street, that had GREAT food options. Parking was easy as long as it wasn't a bad time (late on a weeknight, etc...), but we didn't even need to drive because buses and trains were walking distance. The studio was clean, comfortable, and everything we needed. Perfect location but still relaxing and secluded enough. Would definitely come back!Richard and Victoria were accommodating and welcoming - the studio had everything we could have needed. A fantastic location, literally 6 minutes (driving) to everything! We enjoyed the historic homes and the beautiful update of the studio - very clean and inviting. Comfortable and relaxing space, with a great yard (in full bloom for our visit).\\nStaying here made our visit so enjoyable - close to all, wonderful to come back to after a long day of sightseeing and visiting, and hosts available and friendly! It was a very nice, clean studio with quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended!Well-maintend and nice apartment. Richard was a great and professional host - everything perfect.\"\n",

      "  'Hey there,\\nI am Katharina. I grew up and studied in Germany but moved to the US for work. I have been living in Boston now since August 2012. In my free time I do a lot of sports: triathlon, skiing, rowing,... what is perfect to do in Boston. Apart from that I love to travel (Europe, Southern and Northern America and South- East Africa...), meeting new people, read and go to the theater or ballet. I used airbnb before with a friend who also has an account here and loved it. I think it is such a great idea, so that is why I now created my own account :-). When I travel I like to have a clean and quite place to relax and to explore the city. I think airbnb is a great opportunity to rent a place and to explore the city not from a tourist point of view but also to see some local sides :-).'\n",

      "  'Apartment was as advertised and the host was both communicative and helpful.   A nice alternative to a hotel and close to pretty much everything you need.  The neighborhood is very nice, right on the T line, restaurants close by. The studio is small, clean and very pleasant. If you have a car, consider another neighborhood - there is absolutely no parking anywhere. Very nice and comfortable apt. Close to T train. Feels like home. \\nSofa bed was good but real bed would be better Katharina was very responsive when we had questions and Maureen was accommodating for our late arrival. The studio was nice and clean and everything we needed for our long weekend in Boston. It is a bonus that it was so close to 3 different trains on the green line, making it easy to see different parts of the city. A great experience for our first time using AirBnB.\\nThis studio was perfect for my stay in Boston. It was nice, in a good neighborhood, comfortable and near BC which is what I needed for my trip. Easy access to public transportation. The building is older and does have the normal sounds you\\'d expect from neighbors all around (hearing them walk above you), but no loud music or anything like that. The bed is a sofa bed so it\\'s not the most comfortable but perfectly acceptable for a short stay. Katharina was easily contacted as was her MIL Maureen who was especially helpful. She made other arrangements for me specifically when we realized my short self wouldn\\'t be able to access where the keys are normally kept and I really appreciated that. I would definitely stay there again if I come back to Boston!Great neighborhood and location next to the T (B Line).  The apartment was just as described and was very comfortable with a delightful atmosphere that was most welcoming. Katharina was very quick to respond to messages and easy to work with.  The unit is cozy yet bright and has everything one might need and especially enjoyed the little kitchen.  Overall, staying here was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to others.  Such a lovely place to stay, and it was super convenient being so close to Boston College! I could definitely see myself coming back here should I find myself once again in the Chestnut Hill area. Katharina and Maureen were fantastic. Muareen even made sure there was coffee available for me for the duration I my stay. Overall, the place wa exactly as described and worked perfect for my needs. It is so close to the trains for getting around town. The neighborhood around the receiver is beautiful. The building is older and is quite nice. The age of the building does make carryover noise from the other units noticeable but completely tolerable. There street noise can be a bit loud but that is to be expected in the city. Also, the bed is pullout sofa  but it was comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and would be happy to stay here again. Perfect for a single traveler or couple. Katharina and Maureen were very welcoming and easy to deal with, prompt and helpful. Bottled water and bananas were a nice extra touch. The apartment is not beautiful, really, but it is comfortable, quiet, safe, private -- everything I could have wanted for a weekend in Boston. The sofabed is modern, with no bar across the backside; I slept well there. And the location can\\'t be beat, with a T stop on the block, shops nearby and Zipcars handy.Nice apartment on the 3rd floor over Commonwealth ave. A good location, with a  convenient and pleasant to walk to Boston College. Also very convenient for  the Green line (B, C and D) for getting into Boston.My parent\\'s stay at Katherina\\'s place was great. Katherina\\'s mother in law was very helpful and responsive. The bed was not the most comfortable but that was expected since I knew it would be a pullout couch. The location is great and near BC and the T lines.nettes kleines Appartement, schön gelegen direkt an einem See, der zum sich zum Joggen eignet. Es sind drei Linien der \"Green Line\" zu Fuß erreichbar, die einen in die Innenstadt bringen. Ein richtiges Bett wäre besser, für ein paar Tage geht es aber auf der Schlafcouch. Etwas hellhörig und der Lärm der Straße ist relativ laut, allerdings ist in der Nacht kaum Verkehr.Communication was great and the location was perfect - steps from the B and C line, and great if you want to go around Boston College and the Chestnut Hill Reservoir.This is a confortable studio in a very nice neighbourhood. The kitchen was very well equipped, with coffee machine, toaster, oven, microwave, etc, which was really convenient.\\n\\nIt was a great experience.Good studio with separate kitchen and bathroom and comfortable fold-down bed - just as described. Maureen was very helpful indeed - going so far as to stand in a parking space outside while I drove round the block! A bit of traffic noise, but no more than might be expected given the location. Nice neighbourhood. Cleveland Circle is only 10 minutes walk away with convenience stores, restaurants and an alternative access to a different (and shorter) line of the T.  We\\'d go back. Nice apartment with good coneection to the public transportstion.Apartment was great. Just minutes from a train station and in a good location. Hosts were really easy to get in contact with.Our host was great and very helpful whenever we needed anything, and even stayed up past midnight to help us move in. Place was clean and comfortable. Overall, very nice stay!Well located with access to 3x Green T lines. The A/C proved to be essential as Summer high temperatures were reached. Bonus fresh coffee was grinned for our mornings.'\n",

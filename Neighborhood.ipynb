From the outside the house didn't look so inviting but the inside was very nice! Even though Islam himself was not there everything was prepared for our arrival. The airport T Station is only a 5-10 min walk away. The only little issue was that all the people in the house had to share one bathroom. But it was not really a problem and it worked out fine. We would recommend Islams place for a stay in Boston. \", 'The room was nice and clean and so were the commodities. Very close to the airport metro station and located in quite safe area. Islam responds very quickly and is very helpful. I would recommend it. ', 'Great location. Just 5 mins walk from the Airport Station. Good food nearby.\\nRoom was simple, clean, just what I was after.', 'A truely exeptional place to stay.

Thanks a lot.\\n', 'Islam is a very nice guy ! Attentive, funny, he gave me recommandation and info about boston ( nightlife, places to go and so on) \\nHis flat is clean, tidy and there is a patio which is a real plus! \\nI DO recommand this, great experience !', \"The place is really well furnished, pleasant and clean. Islam was very helpful, you can feel free to ask him virtually anything and he'll help you. He was fun too, very cool talking to him. Oh, and the place is pretty conveniently located too.

Truly a wonderful place and a lovely host!\", \"Our stay at Islam's was very enjoyable, Islam is a very kind and responsive host.\\nThe room was clean and comfortable and the house is provided with all comforts: full kitchen, satellite TV, comfortable living room, excellent WIFI connection in all areas.\\nIt is extremely conveniently located to downtown Boston (a few metro stops) and walking distance to the free shuttles connecting to the airport. \", \"Communication with Islam and his brother was good. However, we arrived at their house and the toilet was completely plugged up and full of excrements. At this point, we were totally disgusted. We went out to town, which by train takes about 15mn plus 10mn walk to the station. We managed to speak with Islam brother. He fixed the problem when we came back by 4pm. \\n\\nThe house is basic with thin walls and the bedrooms are minimum comfort. We were supposed to be on the basement, which I really don't recommend. Bad smell and the bed is for one person rather than two. We stayed in the upper room, as we though we were there. Nobody in the house except from one guest staying also in the upper level. \\n\\nIslam sent us an email during our stay, which we couldn't see as we didn't have a computer with us or the use of our smartphone. However, he told us to stay in the basement while no booking was made for the upper room. Not sure why he wanted us to stay in the basement where the room and bed were very basic, when he could have told us to stay in the room upstairs!\\n\\nThe fact that the owner wasn't there made it a strange feeling. The back door in the kitchen were not locked at all, while our luggage was in the house. We didn't got told at all. We had to put a bar across to kinda off close the sliding door but felt very unsafe as anybody could have walking in easily or made their way in.\\n\\nAll in all, things went fine by the end but we definitely not recommend the place unless the owner is there. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and don't mind of those inconvenience, then you will like it.\\n\\nA part from that Boston is a great city and we had fun!\\n\\n\", 'Mi estadía en Boston aunque corta fue muy buena, la habitación excelente, muy limpia y ordenada, no tuve ningún inconveniente dentro de la casa. Si vuelvo a Boston volveré a buscarlos. Gracias!! ', 'Well sized room for two people with the basic necessities which also included a mini fridge.

I would definetly come back!', \"Izzy was great... had clear instructions and no problems entering the house... the neighborhood wasn't great though.\", 'The place was really good, it is like 10 minutes from the airport so it was  perfect for me because i had a connection flight, the taxi will cost u max 15 dolars and if you go by shuttle is free, the house is very clean and the room was very confortable. The only thing is that i arrive and the owner wasnt there and i didnt read the instructions where he told me how to get in the house so i was waiting for about an hour, but if you read the instructions everything will be fine.', \"The host wasn't there, but it was fine. He left clear instructions, and we spent 2 good nights there.

The neighborhood is ok, had some good Colombian food.\", 'Izzy was a nice and helpful host with detailed directions. The room is in the basement and even though Izzy mentions it we somehow missed that detail and it has narrow stairs leading down to it which made it hard for us to carry our bags up and down.

Check-in was quick and easy and the room as described. It's also very close to downtown Boston. We had a perfect stay and would definitely stay there again.\\n\", 'Izzy was quick to reply to our request, and provided thorough instructions related to finding and entering the home. We loved the convenience of the location near the airport, as we weren\\'t familiar with Boston, and landed late at night, so we didn\\'t want to have to travel far or follow complicated directions to find the place. Although we never had any face-to-face contact with Izzy or anyone else in the home during our brief overnight stay, we felt comfortable there. Although we were assured that the neighborhood was safe, we were still feeling a bit on edge walking late at night from the Airport \"T\" station. Nonetheless, we made our way there without incident, and had a restful night of sleep before launching out the next day. Thanks, Izzy!', 'Everything is exactly as posted! super convenient + easy to find.', 'We didn´t meet Izzy at all!!!! After we arrived nobody was there except some spanish speaking people.\\nOur room was disgusting!!! It smelted like mold and was very dirty!!!!\\nThe Bathroom wasn´t cleaned either and my friend and i wanted to leave right after we came…\\nThe Dryer or washer was not usable because the assistant from Izzy washed all the time.\\nThe Neighborhood is not safe at all and every other morning u could hear people fight.\\nDon´t stay there!!!!!! It´s nothing like u would expect it! \\nAnd it´s defenetly to expensive for this nasty place!!!! ', \"I didn't get a chance to meet Izzy but I thought the system that was set up was really well done. Things went quite smoothly upon arrival as per the detailed instructions that were left. \\n\\nWe managed to get the key from the lock box easily which was nice because it provided flexibility for whatever time we arrived. This place is extremely close to the airport. I've never stayed next door to the airport before. Less than a 5 min ride to Airport Station which was then a 5 min walk.\\n\\nPlace had everything. Felt very homely like staying at a friends. Location was amazing!! East Boston has some hidden gem restaurants and proximity to Airport subway station was key. No complaints about the room or bathroom.\\n\\nGreat setup Izzy!\", \"Izzy's assistant was a nice and helpful person. We stayed 7 days, kitchen had everything one needs to make good food even a mixer! Our room was in the cellar and therefore very private. One fight next door where we heard screaming and shouting but overall a very calm neighbourhood and friendly people.\", \"Host wasn't there, but instructions were clear to find and get in the place. Convenient location and a decent neighborhood (safe but a bit run-down and not much around). The room was basic but had everything I needed.\", \"Izzy's place was very convenient for getting to the airport. The room was cosy and clean. I was impressed with the tea selections. Izzy's friend was helpful and friendly. Definitely will come back when we have to fly out from Boston again!  \", 'Well we were kind of annoyed to be honest. We chose the most expensive room in the house because we were meant to be the only ones on the bottom floor, and we were told we would get a computer...\\nWell we had his assistant sleep right outside our door and we did not have a computer. \\nOn top of that, every room had a TV but ours, and the tv in the living room did not get basic channels which frustrated us. \\n\\nThe house was a mess up until the day we left, because izzy was apparently coming home that day, so his assistant decided to clean up. It was a totally different house upon checkout. \\nHis assistant was lovely, just not much help...\\nAs far as The location goes, it is convenient to downtown and the airport, and has local shops and restaurants close by. \\nWe did enjoy our stay overall there was just more than enough frustrating elements..', \"We never met our host, but they were willing to book the room with little notice.  The room was clean.\\n\\nThere's a little cafe a few blocks up the street that made for a perfect breakfast.\\n\\nWe didn't realize that other people would be staying too, so when they came it was a little spooky until we met them.\", 'It was a great place to stay. Quiet, clean and close to shops, airport and public transportation.  Would recommend and stay here again.', 'Overall a pleasing experience.  We flew into Boston for one night to go to a concert.  Izzy left straight forward and easy to read instructions on how to reach the flat, and enter.  The room was as pictured, and exactly what we needed for the night. Izzy was readily available to us by phone or text whenever we had any questions. The flat is really close to the airport, and only a small hop into the heart of Boston, it was very convenient for us! :)', \"Boston is one of the best city's I have ever been.\\nIssy's place is good located, and nice. \\nI would recommend this place for everybody!\", 'Clear directions.  Good neighborhood. Close to t station. Clean room. Quiet. Perfect!', 'The host actually gave us a place to sleep. It is really simple. Very close to subway was perfect. There have several problems the host needs to improve. ', \"OK stay.  Perhaps best for those on the young/adventurous side of the spectrum!  There was a sign that said 'in the process of renovations'.   I think the second floor might be a little noisy some evenings, with 3 rooms up there. The one lower/ground floor room was quieter, but keep in mind not easily accessible with narrow winding stairs. Futon style bed.     The host was prompt with text message responses to questions about parking.  Parking in the neighborhood mid-day was easy but all streets were filled with parked/double parked cars by 5pm.  It was a fairly short walk to the Blue line train line - Airport station. \", \"Izzy was very helpful with directions and he was easy to get in touch with, as I had some questions.  This is a great location that is a short walk to the airport shuttle.  The room is in the basement and it gets hot during the day.  The house has A/C upstairs, but this does not reach the basement room so it was pretty hot.  The neighborhood a little bit ethnic, which I didn't mind, but if this makes you uncomfortable you might want to look elsewhere.  I felt safe, and the lockbox system is secure.  \\n\\nFor a traveler like myself who had an early flight out of Logan, this was the cost effective option.  Can't beat the price for a location so close to the airport!\", \"This was ok it was easy with clear information on how getting in the house and it was very safe. The host wasn't there during the stay. The neighborhood is not so nice to hang out at night.\", 'Izzy was out of the town when I stayed there. The location is very close to the airport, and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly.  I enjoyed my stay there and made a reservation for an additional night. ', 'Unfortunately, we can\\'t agree with the many positive reviews. The house was easy to find and just a short 7 minute walk from the T-Station \"Airport\", but not what I would describe as clean. After arrival I started to clean a bit. E.g. the hob in the spacious kitchen, which you can use including all the inventory(and what\\'s perfect for a nice breakfast), was kind of greasy and that didn\\'t change during our three day stay. Sure this isn\\'t a hotel and the guests are responsible for cleanliness as well, but the host takes a cleaning fee. If they would clean the house on a regular basis, it would be a nice accommodation, as we really liked the premises. Our basement room had a little fridge, a mirror, a tv and a luggage stand what we appreciated. Somehow we missed the \"warm welcome\" feeling  we experienced at other airbnb locations. ', \"East Boston is very nice place, well connected to the whole city and all services needed at walking distance. \\nThe house is exactly as described, very easy to find and check in, lots of common space and nice environment. Izzy does not living in, but it's not a problem at all! He's very helpful and answered immediately to every need we had.\\nThe house is clean, not so much the room in the basement.\", 'We arrived late and left early in the morning but everything was good. Easy to find, good instructions,  comfortable bed.', \"Izzy's room is a great value for an airport related stay. The convenience to the airport is even better than it seems in the description. \\nThe room was clean as were sheets and towels. \\nThe room could have benefitted from AC because it was August but Izzy gave us a powerful and quiet fan so we were okay.\", 'Had a good experience overall. Short and sweet. ', \"It was a pleasant stay although we didn't meet personally. The room was comfortable, the metro station is close and it is really fast to get into Boston so al together we had a great time there.\", \"Izzy's home is conveniently located for anyone visiting Boston and we were made to feel very at home. The neighborhood appears sketchy and was uncomfortable to walk through at night. Still an overall positive experience.\", \"Izzy's listing was as described, the room was perfect for our short stay at Boston. Although we never got to meet izzy, his brother made us feel more than welcome and helped us with anything we needed.

We didn't get to use the one only bathroom, which is shared by all.  There are 4 rooms with a total of 8 people, so it's like sharing one bathroom with 8 people.\", \"Izzy's place is the perfect location for those leaving to and from Logan airport, really short walking distance and a few subway stops to downtown Boston. We had a nice stay at Izzy's. The room was clean and Izzy provided a very detailed instruction of how to get to the house and everything we might need. If there's any downside I can think of is that there's only one washroom in the house and sometimes there's a wait time to use it due to the many other guests that stayed in the house. Overall, we barely have any issues and enjoyed our vacation at Izzy's place. Cheers! \", \"Staying at Izzy's was very convenient, especially because we had had all the information needed prior to our stay. The place was exactly as pictured. To me its location was definitely the winner, access to airport and subway was really easy. On top of that, the house was clean and well taken care of. Despite being situated in the basement, the room was also very nice and quite spacious. I liked how we had enough shelving to put our things. The only thing I wished to be different was that there was only one bathroom for all guests to share. \", 'The room was as advertised.  It was comfortable and clean.

Our room is located on the first floor of the house, and is very spacious and clean. The living room, kitchen and bathroom are all clean, spacious and cozy. Izzy offered various tea bags, coffee, chocolate, fruit, bread etc. which is very nice. This place really feels like home. \\n\\nIzzy's really warm and kind. He helped us carry luggage to our room and opened mistakenly closed room door early in the morning. The Italian seafood place he recommended, Rino's, is beyond delicious!

I believe that Izzy chose that room for me as he considered the nature of my trip. It was very quiet as it was separate from other areas. I could rest well every night. The room temperature was perfect for my comfortable stay. The house was well-maintained and very clean. I strongly felt that it was a home away from home in that sense. Rosie was very nice.

I went there the day after the snow storm. Arrived at South Station. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) taught me to walk 15 mins to the blue T line. But I took the silver line and then the free airport shuttle. It was actually better option considering my heavy luggage. I arrived the day after the snow storm. The distance from the airport subway station to the apartment wasn't far, but the excessive snow made it really difficult to walk. The pathways were narrow n the steps were hard to climb with my luggage. But by evening, it was nice that the snow were shoveled from the steps. I personally like the place a lot - homey and comfy and has everything I need. It's easy and fast to get to the airport n main attractions too.\", 'We stayed with Izzy just for one night because it was close to Logan airport and I had a flight the next morning.

The direction from the public transportation were very straight forward and explained everything very well. Once we arrived at the place, we fount very clean, well-decorated, and welcoming rooms. A personal welcome note further helped us considering this place as our new home for two days. We shared the entire house with two other airbnb'ers, which were really nice and polite as well.

There was even a small space heater to keep me warm during the night. Everything was well-organized and welcoming. The other guests were very nice as well. I would definitely stay here again!\", 'Everything was great--izzy was very detailed in his instructions and it was an easy stay!', 'The place was as advertized - a private room, great price, close to the airport, etc. And while I am reluctant to give negative feedback I felt that Izzi is running an operation here that is not consistent with my values, and what I believe are the implicit values of the AirBnB \"community.\"\\n\\nThe host actually does not live in the place, rather he lives out of state and has some caretaker changing the sheets and keeping the place clean. So in essence the place is a low security hotel or hostel - except with no management present to deal with any contingencies that might come up between guests. Given that there is shared intimate space the proprietor is relying on the generally good character of the \"AirBnB Community\" to make sure that nothing untoward occurs. Chances are that nothing untoward will occur, but it is an exposure.\\n\\nWhat I also feel is happening in this sort of operation is that it is a business being run in a residential area - compromising the coherency of the neighborhood and riding on the infrastructure of legitimate hotels  (who pay hotel taxes, liability insurance, employment taxes, and other commercial fees) while not paying for the infrastructure that these taxes and fees pay for.\\n\\nThis is America, where entrepreneurial enterprise is rewarded. But this is also America where this can mean concentrating enterprise efforts on profit centers, and externalizing cost centers. The impacts of that externalization do not decrease the costs, they just end up in someone else in-basket.  My sense of conviviality eschews externalizing costs to the expense of the neighborhood or local businesses.', \"The space is nice enough and it's *great* value. I wouldn't say that the way that the host welcomed me was especially warm and friendly -- there was a form message that instructed me on how to get into the apartment. I think the message could be more personalized.\", 'It was very nice, everything was fine and comfy, even though the host didnt stay at all in the house (no big deal)', \"Great location for the airport - however we couldn't go through the park as the gate was locked, which made getting to the airport for our early morning flight a little stressful. Otherwise - great room, great location and great price!\", \"Close to the airport, affordable, hardly knew i was in someones house it was so quiet. Can't really ask for more for your stopover in Boston. Make sure you leave with plenty of time to go North of the East Boston Memorial Park if your flight is in the early morning as the gates will be chained. Going up the greenbelt trail i was able to make it to the T station in plenty of time.\", 'Izzy\\'s place was extremely convenient fir us since it\\'s so clise to the airport and just twi subway stops away from downtown. we loved to see the \"real\" Boston in a cool, safe neighborhood, and also loved some of the restaurants nearby. Although we didn\\'t get to meet Izzy, he was very accomodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend fir anyone looking for good value in Boston.', \"Izzy's communication is very good. All communication was done via text or AirBnB messaging. Directions and house details were well spelled out & clear. I was in the basement room of the 3 rooms he rents out. Everything is clean but spares. I would not consider it cozy but it was a very good value. \", \"I did not see Izzy during my stay, but the check-in instructions delivered by email were very clear. The home is run much like a hostel - I was welcomed by a white-board on the door of my room.  Everyone else staying in the house was very nice and helped me feel at home. There are shared tea/coffee supplies, slippers, and a space heater for my room, all of which were nice touches! The neighborhood is Mexican-American, with many ethnic food choices. There was no great place for groceries or coffee, but Santarpio's pizza is the best in Boston and is within walking distance of the house (cash only - worth every penny!) The Government Center Station on the T is closed until 2016, which means you have to make at least 2 transfers to get anywhere downtown or in Back Bay.  Had I realized this before my stay, I would have probably stayed downtown. Taxi drivers grumbled about driving to East Boston because of the tolls and my Taxi/Uber fares for 2 days cost nearly $100. \", \"Our stay was quite good at Izzy's place. Getting in touch with him was easy, he is very reachable and answers quickly to all the questions. We arrived really early in the morning but we managed to put our stuff in the house before the check-in. The location is perfect for people travelling from the airport - it's a 7 minutes walk to the subway station and a 10 min subway ride to downtown which is fine. \\nThe only problem with the house is that there is only one bathroom for 4 rooms, so it's kind of bothering when everyone wants to shower in the morning.\\nAnd -1 for the cleaning and the garbage that was not changed in the room after the ones that were there before us!\\nBut overall it's a good price/value room, specially that it's in the basement so far from the other rooms.\", 'I checked in at midnight. & left at. 9:00 am.

Overall I was pleased with the place', \" I enjoyed my stay at Izzy's place. He gave me very detailed directions, so finding his place was a breeze. My room was in the basement which made it feel more private. The room had a fridge, mirror, towels, hangers and even slippers. Sharing a bathroom was a little tricky, but no one ever took too long.  The bathroom did need a bit of cleaning, especially the bathtub. Getting to and from downtown Boston was relatively easy once you get the hang of the subway system. The neighborhood was nice, we saw parents walking their kids to school in the morning and I felt safe walking late at night. Overall this is a great value. I would stay here if I'm ever in Boston again.\", 'Izzy is very friendly and he provided assistance when I was there ,which made us feel like living in our own home.\\nThe room is clean and tidy.

We were in the basement which was comfortable, well furnished and clean.  I wish I had known I was going to get the basement room. I probably wouldn't have stayed there.

The bathroom was inconveniently placed on a different floor to us and was shared with approx. 3 other guests, making for plenty of waiting time.

Easy to get to from public transit.', 'The room was very cozy and nice with all the necessary utilities like portable heater, towels, blankets, etc. I enjoyed my stay a lot.', \"I didn't get to meet Izzy but we exchanged some messages and he seemed to be really nice, the room was cozy and clean, I would definitely stay at this place again.\", 'Room is nice an clean with all the necessary utilities. Just a few stops from the city center with a train. Overall a great experience and highly recommended.', \"The only thing I messed up was not looking at the page of information after we booked. All the information you need to check in and get settled into your room was all there. I did call Izzy and he responded promptly through phone or text. The room was secluded and the place was quiet. I recommend Rino's restaurant, which is like 5 minutes from Izzy's!! Definitely recommend staying here.\", 'I was in the basement room so it was a bit cold but there was a nice portable heater and a small refrigerator. It had nice shelving to hang your clothes and a clean bed. Overall, a great place to stay. Thank you!', 'This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was amazing! We had the room in the basement which was very private, clean, and warm on one of the coldest days in Boston. There was a space heater we could use which helped, on the day it was -30 degrees Celsius outside. There were also clean extra blankets, lots of pillows and the bed was very comfortable and clean as well. The host also provided us with clean towels, and we were able to lock our door for privacy. The lady we talked with was also very kind and friendly. The location is also very close to the airport subway station, which makes it easy to get around. I would definitely stay here again thank you so much for your hospitality!  ', \"Izzy's home is really well located in a nice neighbourhood with easy access to the airport and downtown Boston. However we found it a bit strange that we didn't meet Izzy once - we like to choose our hosts based on their personal profile as well as the room listing so this was a bit disappointing. The lady who was there was very sweet and showed us where everything was but we didn't really click so we didn't spend much time at all in the communal areas. The room is spacious with plenty of natural light and was fairly clean, however there was a really loud vent that came on and off all the time, I'm not a particularly light sleeper but it often woke me and there were no ear plugs provided or option to turn it off as it heats the whole house. Overall we had a fine stay, it was a lot more like a bnb (without the breakfast) or a hostel than a home, but it was all ran professionally and other than the noise we had no real problems.\", \"Pleasant one night stay at Izzy's home. The bed was comfortable, the room (and house overall) was very clean, and directions for check-in were clear. Amazing value!\", 'The apartment was cozy and clean and came with all the necessary utilities. The basement room also included a small heater and refrigerator. Overall a pleasant experience and would stay here again. ', \"I had a great stay at Izzy's. The apartment is easy to access and the self check in was a breeze. The room was comfortable and private, and all the amenities were clean and organized. I had a lovely breakfast with Rosa, who made fresh bread, and the other guests. Definitely a great choice when traveling through Boston!\", \"The stay at Izzy's was just what I needed.  Communication was quick and easy, I was able to drop off my luggage early, the room was clean and as advertised.  Great location for me going to the airport and was able to immediately catch an Uber even at 4 in the morning.\", \"Very nice private room. For the price, it's unbeatable. Not really central, but close to T station (blue line). Nice clean bathroom, cozy space. Would stay again.\", \"This was our second time stay although on a different room which turned out even better. There was so much privacy since the room is downstairs with a (URL HIDDEN)'t meet Izzy this time but Rosa was sweet and helpful too. Highly recommend this place.\", \"I had a great stay at Izzy's place. Izzy was quick and helpful in communication. The instructions for getting into the house and finding the room were very clear and worked, no problem. We locked ourselves out of our room at one point and the woman watching the house had a spare which was a relief.\\n\\nThe room and house were as described and very comfortable. I slept really well! The neighborhood was lovely and getting to and from the subway was very easy and convenient to the rest of Boston.\", \"This was a cozy room with a comfortable bed. We felt very welcome. Great location if you're coming in from the airport. Izzy was really helpful.\", \"Très pratique pour allez à l'aéroport !\\nChambre agréable ;)\", \"Host house was very clean and welcoming! Our room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. We were in Boston for Pax East this weekend, and so were away from the host home for a vast majority of the time. The neighborhood was quiet, with a nice park nearby which lead directly to public transit, and was only about a 36 minute commute to the convention center via bus. We hope to attend PAX again next year, and Izzy's place just might have to be our same choice!\", 'I arrived late at nite and did a self check-in, leaving early the next morning for a flight out of Logan. Everything was as described, no problems with the checkin-in or anything else. Perfect place to stay if you have an early morning flight.', \"If you're looking for a clean, quiet place for a stopover in Boston near the airport, this is the place! I was quite pleased with my stay! Just minutes from the airport in a quiet, working class neighborhood dotted with great restaurants and markets. Our basement room was clean and quiet. The house was full but all the other guests were polite and friendly. The common areas were clean and inviting. Izzy provides quick and simple self check-in and check-out instructions. We walked to a great restaurant, Rino's, from Izzy's place. Great home base in Boston!\", \"Izzy's place was great. Good price, conveniently located, easy to find and get into.\", \"It was amazing to stay in Izzy's place. The house was beautiful clean and organized! Highly recommended!\", \"Great place to stay near the airport and easy to get downtown. The self check-in was perfect for us so we didn't have to disturb anyone getting in from a late flight. Izzy was great at responding to all of our questions and making the reservation for us. \", 'Izzy wrote a welcoming message on the door of our room.  There are two other renters and it was enjoyable meeting and talking with them.   We never met or spoke with Izzy but talked with a women who tried her best to assist us but could not.  The room was fine but the experience was negatively affected by the difficult parking.  Most streets are two hours only unless you have a sticker.  We spent too much time trying to find nearby overnight parking and there was none. After much frustration, we finally located parking about 1/2 mile away.  We had use of the kitchen for breakfast, but the pots and pans for cooking were not as good as we might have liked.  In summary, the room was fine but the parking and kitchen made this a negative experience.', 'Wonderful. Close to the airport and easy to get here. Lots of stores open even at night. Safe and quiet neighborhood, clean and comfortable bedroom. I really enjoy my stay in Boston.', 'We liked our stay even though it was just for one night. Very close to the airport. ', 'Very close to the airport, clear directions. Nice one bedroom with bathroom upstairs. Host was efficient! An AC unit would have been helpful! ', \"Great location, comfortable room, clean common areas, friendly guests, easy check-in. Not a five-star resort, but if you want a clean,  comfortable bedroom for the night it's great!\", 'Check-in/check-out was easy and it waa easy to get to the house from the metro station which took me only 5 mins or even less. The house was clean but only problem was that there was only one bathroom but other than, the house is a perfect place to stay. ', \"I was happy to find a sort of communal hostel upon my return from nine months of backpacking thru South America. There was no way I was going to stay in some awful franchise but I wanted something near the airport for a late night arrival after long international flights. I was very happy with my stay - the room was comfortable and the shared facilities were well organized and welcoming. Because I was jet lagged I went straight to bed but would have otherwise been interested in spending time with the other travelers staying here. Additionally there were a number of Salvadoran restaurants that looked  great - cheap and cheerful - so you can have tasty ethnic food just minutes from the door. The neighborhood is safe and friendly - it's a low income Hispanic residential section of town - and I enjoyed walking around smiling and waving to the locals sitting on their stoops.\", \"I spent three nights here and enjoyed my stay. I never saw the host, and there were other guests staying at the house. I don't think anyone actually lives here and the house is used for air bnb, but I'm not entirely sure. The location is super convenient to the airport and to the T that gives you access to the City of Boston. Family neighbourhood that was very quiet. The bed is super comfortable and the interent was great.  Izzy also kindly let me store luggage in the house during the day before my early evening flight.\", \"I was very thankful to find this place.  I was stranded over night in Boston, and this place was available and within walking distance of the airport (after the free shuttle ride to the train station). \\n\\nI never saw Izzy or anyone else. It's a little pricey for the quality, and smells like animal in one area, but it was exactly what I needed, when and where I needed it! \", \"The house was easy to find from the airport train staton, just a quick walk through the park. On our first night we met friends for dinner and after dropping off our things, I noticed a sign on the park gates saying 'closed at 11 pm'. We had a bit of a rush to make it back in time and got off the T at 10.56! I am not sure how observant they are of the park closing times, but it's something to keep in mind. The basement room was clean, comfortable and private, which I appreciated. Having one bathroom for a house with 4 bedrooms meant that there was often a wait for the shower/ toilet, but we managed. There were plenty of Boston brochures and maps about the house for guests to use, which was handy, great to help us decide how to use our three days in town. The house was clean and welcoming, with the hand towel and bath mat seemingly changed daily. The shower did need a bit of a clean though the rest of the bathroom as spotless. we could have done with a towel rail or some kind of hooks on which to hang our towels in our room. Otherwise despite the heat, they could be slow to dry. We loved the fact it wa just 3 stops from the action, so getting in in the morning and home at night was such a simple and quick process. Very happy withour stay.\", 'Super', \"The house is clean and our room was just as described. It is very close to the metro station and only a few stops away from downtown. The instructions to get to the house from the airport were also very helpful and easy to follow. Izzy was very helpful with suggestions for things to do in Boston. We had the opportunity to interact not only with him but with his assistant Fabi and other gusts as well. Everyone was very nice and polite. If you're looking for a clean and affordable place to stay in Boston, Izzy 's place is definitely a good option. \", 'Me and my wife rented this room for 1 night.Location was good, near to the airport. The room and common spaces were clean. I highly recommend.', 'Property was easy to find, extremely clean, very safe, and convenient to the airport and rental car areas.  Much easier than staying at a hotel nearby for more money.  Izzy was very easy to reach and a great host!', 'nothing what I expected !\\nwe start from the position..the house is in a very bad boston district where there is nothing and there live exclusively Latinos (hispanic district) ! the metro is a 10 min walk but if you come back late at night you have to go for strength to a park where there are not recommended subjects . we had always come back soon because we were afraid something happened to us ! neighborhood dirty, ugly people , no restaurant !\\nas it regards the room was in the basement ... with a small WC designed in under 1 meter scale .\\nall very dirty and very poorly maintained.\\nnobody helped us by giving us indications\\nterrible experience .', \"The house uses a self check-in way, the guest can follow the instruction  the host sends before arrival, it was easy and simple. The place is very clean, and we saw a shelf with all those clean towels. we stayed at the first floor, but since one has to go upstairs to get into the house, you have to go downstairs to get into this bedroom. But there are windows and light can get into the bedroom. \\n\\nThe owner was not in the house, but there are stickers with instructions on them all over the house, so it was very convenient. The owner's friend also lives in that house, so she can help guests with what they need.\"]\n",

I am a medical student and was studying at the Massachusetts General Hospital for 6 weeks so it was really important for me to find a place that was clean, private, comfortable, safe and friendly with easy access to Harvard Square/ the red line/ the hospital. Joe's place provided all of this and more! \\n\\nThe room was spacious and clean with air conditioning and a heater. I had easy access to all the facilities I needed including a fully equipped kitchen, laundry facilities and 2 bathrooms. Joe went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and went out and bought an ironing board when I asked if one was available for me to iron my shirts with! All the guests that stayed during my 6 weeks were also respectful and friendly which made my trip even better. \\n\\nThe house is in a pleasant residential area which is quiet at night time but close to all important amenities. The nearest supermarket was only 10 minutes walk away and the number 66 bus route had a stop at the top of the road and had a regular service every 5-10 minutes which took me into Harvard Square within 10 minutes. \\n\\nBetween my excellent hosts and the fantastic location I felt completely at home during my stay and would recommend Joe's place to anyone looking visit Boston without paying the ridiculous price of downtown hotels.

We had a great time at Andrea\\'s place. He is very nice and kind. The neighborhood is super nice and we were very happy to have to opportunity to see a real place where real people live: absolutely worth the trip! Furthermore, the house is beautiful, clean, large and comfortable. We definitely recommend it!Adrea was very welcoming and flexible to our needs. Location had surprisingly ample parking and was located in a very good area. The house was beautiful and well kept and we felt very comfortable for the duration of our stay.Andrea made us feel welcome because he made the effort to meet the train at Rosalind Village. \\nThe room was prepared for us including a connection to the Internet which was very helpful.\\nThe house was like others in the street and gave us a sense of history.Me and my friend were so happy about Andrea\\'s room! Everything is clean and tidy. Andrea was very friendly to us. I am not a pet person but I love his dog which is very quiet. Overall we had a wonderful stay!Andrea was a great host. Very nice, helpful, uncomplicated and absolutly recommendable. The room is perfect for two people and everything is very clean and tidy. Also the neighborhood is very nice. Everything that you need is away a few minutes by foot. The ride to Boston Dowtown is very uncomplicated and short too. If i will go another time to Boston  Andrea would be my first contact point.  We were absolutely pleased and happy to be there.    Andrea was really welcoming and gave us precious advices on activities, transport and other useful informations.\\nHis house area is in a calm neighbourhood and not so far from downtown.\\nThe house is large and has everything we need.\\nOur trip was really great!Andrea was really welcoming and a great host. He was very communicative and was very flexible with our check in time as we had car issues on the drive up to Boston. The apartment and neighbourhood is very charming and cute! Highly recommended. Andrea is very friendly.  The room is nice and clean.  He has a cute and quiet dog.  Love this place.  About 25 minutes drive from this place to Boston downtown.  The bed is really comfortable.Andrea is an excellent host!  The location is great and close to everything.  My girlfriend and I had a terrific experience staying with Andrea. He is very welcoming and the place is well kept and inviting. The bedroom was very tidy and the bed was comfortable. Parking on the street is no problem (we parked right in front of the house on the street). His dog is very sociable and well behaved. This was our first airbnb experience and I would not have changed a thing!Andrea is a very kind and generous host. The place is cute and in a great neighborhood.We stayed for one week, and it was a very pleasant experience. The house was clean and comfortable, and it was only a short walk to several shops and restaurants. The room was a bit small, but comfortable, and the kitchen and living areas were very nice. Andrea was welcoming and helpful, taking the time to help me with the printer and the washing machine.Andrea\\'s place is comfortable and stylish. The guest room is very cozy and quiet. The neighborhood is convenient for walking to small shops (Fornax Bread Company is awesome) and parks. Andrea is a pro host. He is so kind and welcoming. I would stay here again in the future. Thanks!Andrea is a very nice host.Communication was superb.  Andrea is personable and flexible, allowing me to come and go as I please.  The space is great, sunshine pouring in with great views from his hilltop residence.  The bed is very comfortable and a good shower.  My dog enjoyed the space and walks around neighborhood.  Lots of kids and families in the area, very safe and quiet.  Highly recommended.  Andrea was very responsive to our questions and welcomed us thoroughly, including our dog.  The house is lovely, as is the neighborhood.  The room in which we stayed was small, but very nice and the air conditioner is in good condition.  The bathroom is very clean and comfortable.  Although the bathroom is shared with Andrea, he is very considerate about making himself scarce during the mornings and evenings when we were using it.  At our request, Andrea allowed us to leave our dog for several hours while we went out to dinner.  Andrea is an extremely pleasant guy, and we enjoyed talking with him.  Our dog liked him, too.  We would definitely go back.Bei Andrea war alles sehr unkompliziert, was ich sehr zu schätzen wusste! \\nDie Lage war für mich pervekt, ausserhalb und doch nah genug der Stadt, welche man mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln sehr einfach und schnell erreichen konnte.\\nZudem, und dies war in meinem Fall das Wesentlichste, er akzeptierte mich mit Hund und zwar, auf eben diese unkomplizierte, gute Art.Andrea was more than helpful when I arrived in Boston. The apartment was nice and spacious with everything you might need. Just a two minute walk from the commuter rail station and even less to the nearest bus. In short, the stay was above expectations and I would definitely recommend Andrea to anyone who\\'s visiting Boston.The house is located in a quiet neighborhood. Everything is just perfect. I will book it without hesitation if I stop by Boston next time.Very nice host !! Would recommend ++! Thx for the parking cues ;)I lived at Andrea\\'s place for 3 nights. It is just 2 minutes from the public transport and very peaceful. Andrea is kind and supportive providing flexible check in times. I highly recommend it for people who come to Boston for the first time. Andrea was a great, friendly host. My girlfriend and I were only in the Boston area for a few days and spent most of our time in Downtown Boston and Cambridge. Public transit is close by but we ended up using a combination of Lyft and Uber for most trips. Lyft seems to be growing in the area but not quite on the same level as SF (where we are from). Roslindale itself seems like a great place to relax and I definitely recommend checking out the Arthur Aboretum just a little bit north. Overall, I would recommend Andrea - great experience for our first AirBnB!Andrea was a nice guy. We didn\\'t have much interaction, but he seemed like a pleasant guy. That being said, and to be honest, I thought the room, specifically the bed and sheets, smelled like they had been used a lot recently. There was a \"greasy\" feeling to the bed and sheets that made sleeping in it less than desirable. The house also had an unpleasant odor that made me a bit nauseous. Again, Andrea was a nice guy, but I thought a better job could have been done in terms of preparing the place for a stranger. We had an excellent stay at Andrea\\'s place during Thanksgiving. Andrea is a friendly host. The room is larger than it looks in the pictures. There is a wardrobe cabinet. In the cabinet there where towels, coffee, tea. Even toothpaste and brand new toothbrushes, in case you forgot them.\\n\\nThe location is just beyond the reach of Boston metro system, but there are good bus connections to the metro.Andrea was a wonderful host and the nearby Roslindale Village has lots of quirky little attractions. His little dog was a delightful addition! Great experience! Short notice booking very responsive and accomodating.  Very calm peaceful environment.Andrea was our first stay using AirBnb and it was everything we could have hoped for. He was very welcoming, friendly, and respectful. The only thing we regret is not being able to spend as much time with Andrea and Mochino! Thank you for an amazing 5 days in Boston! 10/10 would stay again.The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.Andrea was a great and welcoming host, flexible with check in and check out times. The room and the bathroom was very comfortable and clean, and we felt at home. Although we had to take the metro followed by the bus everyday to get to Andrea\\'s house, would still consider it relatively accessible. Great stay overall, recommended! Andrea was a perfect host. The cabinet with fresh toothbrushes for us and a token for a free coffee at the local coffee shop was a nice touch. What a great experience to start our Airbnb journeys. Andrea was a kind and welcoming host. The place was quiet, the room and bathroom were comfortable and clean. I wasn\\'t able to spend time with Andrea but he seems to be a nice guy. Short notice booking very responsive and accomodating. Andrea is a great host. He was able to pick us up from Forrest Hills station as there weren\\'t any busses running anymore. The place is quite nice and very close to the bus stop to Forest hills station. Thanks Andrea for the nice time and of course your hospitality. Andrea was super organized and our stay went off without a hitch! It was a quiet and charming space just as he describes in the listing. Andrea was available and helpful during our stay. The surrounding area was also a nice retreat from the downtown bustle.I loved staying here. The host is very friendly and accommodating. The place is very nice. Would definitely stay here again.Andrea was super nice! He greeted us late in the evening because we had just driven to there from Ohio. He gave us all of the room information quickly and let us crash like the tired puppies we were. He has an adorable dog, too! The room was just as shown and very cozy. Everything was awesome. ']\n",

      "  \"A Wonderful, pleasant, and charming host.  The bed is very comfortable and the room is nice. Travel wise one is 15 minutes by the Needham Train or Orange Subway Line to Back Bay Station - the Center of Boston.  I highly recommend one staying with Phil. Firstly Phil is a great host! He's very helpful in every aspect of living and having good time in Boston.\\nSecondly Phil's rental is located in a great area surrounded by parks making it nice and quite and yet it close enough to city center which is easily accessible by walking, biking or taking a bus.\\nRental room is very nice and has all that's needed to make it comfortable!\\nIf I was to do it again i wouldn't be looking for any other place but simple book my stay again at Phil's!Phil was a great host and his home was very comfortable.  The room is well furnished and clean, with a comfortable bed, plenty of closet and drawer space, and a nice desk.  TV and sound system too. Phil was extremely hospitable about use of the kitchen and laundry, as well as helping out with rides.  The backyard is awesome - and in summer weather I imagine it would be a great place to relax.  The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and residential - but close to the commuter rail which takes you to downtown Boston in 15 minutes.  There are some really interesting shops in Roslindale Village - just a 7 minute walk from the house.   Supposedly it has the best farmer's market in Boston. \\n...and...\\nif you enjoy Mexican folk art, Phil's home will be especially fun for you.\\nI highly recommend staying there.Phil is a very friendly host and I felt safe and comfortable in Roslindale. It's a very quiet and nice neighbourhood. You have easy access to the commuter train station at Roslindale Village (if you don't mind walking appr. 15 minutes) - but especially on weekends there is only limited service (on Sundays even no service at all). But you can also take the T orange line to Forest Hill and take a bus (there are several lines). If you like to explore Boston during daytime and have quiet evenings and like walking it's worth a stay.Firstly, the room itself was very comfortable to stay in, and included a firm mattress, ample closet and drawer space, a large desk complete with stereo and TV, powerful air-conditioning, and wi-fi. Beyond the parameters of the room, Phil's home is very clean and comfortable to move around in - and filled with beautiful artisan pieces from Mexico! His stories are as colorful as the art pieces he displays. Beyond his knack for conversation, Phil is a supremely kind host, offering rides and opening his home in ways that made me feel like I was staying with a close relative, not with someone I had just met. Outside of the home, there are restaurants, small shops, and a gorgeous park nearby. Public transportation to downtown and around Boston is easy, as the commuter rail is a 15 minute walk and the orange T-line is a short bus ride away (which can be boarded a block from his home). I can easily recommend staying with Phil with no reservations. The room was very comfortable, with clean and colorful bed, TV, Wi-Fi, desk and closet. And also, I could enjoy many Mexican arts in the house. (for free!)\\nPhil is a great host. He kindly provided me with a bath towel, coffee and breads, a new teeth brush and any useful information on Boston, and also he took me to the station with his car.\\nThe location is calm but the public transportation is limited. If you will come back at late time in weekend, you will have to take a taxi from Forest Hills station (It costs $8 or so) or walk 30 minutes.\\nTotally, I was completely satisfied with staying this room.Phil was very accommodating to both my short notice and preference to stay in for the weekend.  I was able to come and go as I pleased and enjoyed the great art.  The room had a space heater, which was great for being able to make the space comfortable to what I prefer.  I was also appreciative of the location and not having to deal with parking nightmares or traffic.  Phil was a great host.  He was accomodating and helpful.  The room was simple, clean and nice, and his collection of Mexican art added fun and whimsy to the atmosphere.  I had to rent a car while travelling, and parking in front of the house was always available and didn't require a permit.  I'd stay with Phil again!Phil is a wonderful host. The house is located in a charming suburb, with easy access to restaurants and public transport. I enjoyed my stay, and will gladly stay again when I am in Boston. My stay at Phil's was great. Phil is a great host, he is very friendly and willing to help if you need anything. I've got several rides to the supermarket and train station, and also helped me out to find the best routes to bike. He is a great cook too, I was once invited to try lobster and his banana bread is awesome !\\n\\nThe house is clean and quiet and so is the neighborhood. Phil is pretty much all the time attending his online business at the studio, so you won't notice him very much.  The bathroom is shared but is very clean and you will get your own cabinet. \\n\\nI would stay at Phil's again, and I definitively recommend it. If you look for a place that the price is very reasonable with conveniently driving to the city, I'd recommend Phil's place. You can imagine how much to pay to stay in a city. Since we drove, it was pretty handy for us, Phil's place is located only 7-8 minutes away or 10+ minutes with traffic. \\n\\nThe place was clean and comfortable, especially Phil was friendly and helpful. We were welcome to share the kitchen. Some places were not.  Well, for me, to say hello and good bye is pretty important in my culture, therefore, we expected host at least saying such things. Phil was way much over the expectation. Thanks Phil.Phil is a great host who goes over and above to make your stay comfortable.  From rides to the subway station, to sharing his DVD collection, his kitchen and his home.  Great location, interesting conversations and nice cozy clean room.I was in Boston on a business trip that was scheduled with only a few days notice. Staying at Phil's place was perfect for my needs and a terrific introduction to the Airbnb experience. The room was clean with a comfortable firm mattress, work desk, and windows facing east for enjoying morning sunshine.\\n\\nI was welcome to use the kitchen and did for breakfasts but found the local eatery around the corner was super convienient for dinners.\\n\\nPhil had some terrific travel stories that he shared on my last evening in Boston. I would recommend staying here and would definitely stay again.This was my second stay at Phil's place while working in the Jamaica Plain area. This stay was as comfortable, clean, and welcoming as my first visit. We had time to talk about some of the Mexican artwork he sells.\\n\\nPhil's a host who is attentive to his guests and made my stay very easy to unwind after long hours working. If you like being in a large city and having a quiet spot to relax, this is the place for you.Phil was great, helpful and very kind during my staying in Boston. He gave to me all the necessary information to move around the city and helped me also finding another apartment while I was living there.\\nThe place was big enough, confortable and located near public transportaion. I would recommend this place to everyone !! I really enjoyed staying with him.I could not be happier with my first Airbnb experience. Having Phil as a host, to be fair, most likely had something to do with it. The room and environment was exactly as advertised with my space being clean, private and functional. I had full access to Phil's kitchen, bathroom and laundry amenities as needed. Phil himself was pleasantly conversant yet professionally distant to help maintain his and my work schedules. I was able to leave early in the morning and come back late per the duties of a medical student without incident.  I highly recommend Phil's Airbnb listing to anyone wishing to study or needing temporary housing in the Boston area. If I ever needed to return to Boston in similar circumstances, I would surely see if Phil was available. He is a great asset to the Airbnb community. Thanks for a wonderful experience!Staying at Phil's was an excellent way to start off my airbnb journey. Given that I am a noob at airbnb there was a mild hesitation but I am glad I took a leap of faith and stayed at Phil's. Phil is an excellent host and a person. He was very helpful, accommodating and fun to talk with. I had a key to myself and he was fine with me walking in anytime. He gave me access to his washer/dryer in the basement which was very useful. He also suggested a bunch of good places to see around Boston. \\n\\nAbout the house:\\nSafe friendly neighborhood.\\nOld quaint house with lots of character. \\nTons of interesting art pieces (like Phil mentioned in his ad)\\nThe room is spacious for one/two people with ample of storage.\\nThe bathroom is clean and in good condition.\\nPlenty streetside parking available outside.\\nThe house is very close to Arnold Arboretum so it is a great place to be in if you like to explore!\\n\\nOverall I would definitely recommend staying at Phil's if you are around the area.Phil is an excellent host, he went above and beyond by taking me to the train station my 1st morning there to make sure I could find it (it is however only a short walk from the house....very convenient for getting into downtown).  He was also a wealth of information about things I might like to do but would not have discovered on my own. The room is clean and comfortable.  I felt very safe both in his home and in the neighborhood.  Thanks Phil!!!The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.Phil was quick to respond and to reach out before the trip to make sure my stay was a pleasant one. The location was great - quick to the bus stop (but not walkable to the T). Bus service is frequent, so it was fine for me.\\n\\nPhil was super flexible about when I checked in and went out of his way to make me feel welcome. It's clear why he has repeat customers. Breakfast makings available and free reign in the kitchen. Good coffee (french press style) was available (although I ended up running out every morning before taking advantage of it.) \\n\\nTheir is a 7-11 less than a block away as well as a restaurant or two that I noticed. Parking was easy. Super quite and safe neighborhood (I caught the wrong bus one night and had to walk about a mile around midnight). \\n\\nThanks Phil for a great first AirBnB experience!Very quiet neighborhood and Phil opens up his apartment home to make your stay pleasant and stress free. If you stay here there is free street parking and the apartment is less than half a block from the bus stop. The room and the shared bathroom are clean. \\n\\nI've stayed here before and returning for a short stay felt very much like visiting family.Phil was a wonderful host and was very accommodating. The guest room is cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Phil had coffee and bagels waiting for me in the morning and he even gave me a snack for the road. The neighborhood felt very safe and has a bar/restaurant, taco joint and convenience store within walking distance. Parking was no problem. I would recommend this listing and this host. Thanks Phil!Phil was an extremely pleasant and kind host.  He was a very giving person and made the stay that much better.  We had a few chats here and there even though I was busy most of the time.  Location was fine for me.  Very quaint area but not far from it all also.  Very accommodating! Great place! Cozy room. Very safe area. Phil is very nice person! I will definitely stay here next time!I couldn't have asked for a better host for my first few days in Boston. Phil gave me expert advice on how to get around town and even drove me a few places on weekends when the public transportation came less frequently. The neighborhood is full of character and things to do. I leave my highest endorsement. Phil was the absolute best!!  After responding within minutes of my last-second request, he waited up late for my arrival (12:30a) and greeted me with a bowl of delicious, homemade minestrone soup.   He was so kind and gracious throughout my stay.  He even drove me to the T station, so I didn't have to walk.  He was the absolute best and I would stay with him again in a second.  I would give six stars if I could.Phil is an amazing host. Always tried to make my stay more comfortable, and was very helpful. He has a very relaxed attitude, which I found to be very pleasant. The room was quite large, and had everything I could possibly need. The room had two windows with a view of his garden, and the decor was also nice. Phil let me use his kitchen, and it had everything I needed.\\nThe house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood. Bus stops are very near (2 min walking). \\nI would definitely come back!My wife & I stayed with Phil for 2 nights when we came over from the UK for the Boston Marathon.  Phil was a delightful host, with the facilities and ambiance of his place being informal and relaxed; exactly what we required. There was good contact with Phil from before our arrival; he was a really convivial host & more than happy for us to use his kitchen (& eat his banana bread!).  It’s a 10min bus ride from the end of Phil’s street to the Orange Line terminus, so you can be downtown in 30mins.  On Sunday, when the bus didn’t run, Phil generously offered & gave us a ride to the ‘T’.  Phil’s place is clean, private, quiet and just a wee bit quirky, with his pieces of Mexican folk art in which he trades peering at you from all directions!  Some are a little bizarre - but in a nice way!  There’s a sports bar, a Mexican restaurant and a Pizza/pasta takeout just round the corner and a 7-11 at the end of the street.  Overall, we enjoyed our brief stay tremendously; just a shame there wasn’t more time to continue the good conversations.  Thank you Phil – you and your place were just the kind of casual, hassle-free bolthole we needed for our short stay in Boston. I was at Phil's place for 2 weeks for a short work assignment. Staying here was convenient with ample street parking, full use of the kitchen, and a quiet room. \\n\\nPhil is very personable and has much to share about Boston. We had some great conversations. \\n\\nI'd certainly stay here again when work brings me back to Boston. Room is very clean, space is adequate, host is very entertaining and welcoming, nice neighborhood, would definitely come backPhil was an excellent host. The room and apartment were well appointed and very comfortable. I very much enjoyed chatting with Phil about his travels and day to day life and his expertise about Boston (as a native) was invaluable to my housing search. This was my first Airbnb experience and Phil has set the bar very high. He was also kind and flexible when my plans changed. I would definitely recommend staying with Phil for those headed to Boston, particularly by car, as his street offers ample parking and quick access to local arteries. Phil was a great host, accommodating and friendly without being intrusive. He provides a beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood steps from the arboretum. Great trip.I stayed with Phil for three months over the summer of 2015. Phil provided me with a comfortable room in his pleasant, art-filled apartment. It was a very convenient location for Faulkner Hospital where I was working....a 20 minute walk. Also, the apartment is a handy place for Forest Hills T-station...a nice walk through the Arboretum. Phil is a great host and, in fact, an all-around good bloke.\\n110% recommendation.I was in Boston for a convention and Phil made my stay there super comfortable and friendly. He was very accommodating and helpful - he was quite generous with his time in assisting me with my stay even though he runs his business from home. The room is cozy and clean, with plenty of desk area for when I needed to do some work. Also when he had the time, Phil even gave me a ride to where I needed to go (I didn't have a car and mostly took the bus/train) and he was very kind to offer me a few home-cooked meals though I mostly ate out at nearby restaurants. His house is beautifully decorated with lots of folk art and I enjoyed hearing his travel and life stories. He has great information and tips on the local sights and dining options as well as commute options.Phil was a delightful host. I found his 1920's era house very appealing.  And I enjoyed our conversations, and hearing about his travel adventures.\\nThe bedroom was perfect for me: pleasantly arranged with a very comfortable bed, with a large desk that I wish I had an opportunity to use. The room was conveniently next to both the bathroom and kitchen. I felt very comfortable and at home at Phil's place.Phil was a wonderful host. He was flexible with check in time, and was highly accommodating to us, letting us borrow his umbrella when it as pouring, among other things. I would definitely stay with Phil again. Phil is a very nice man and a welcoming host. Room and amenities were as described in the post. Good, quiet location with plenty of parking available. I enjoyed staying here.  The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable.  Phil's apartment is within walking distance of great park trails and the Arboretum.  Another great stay at Phil's place.  When we arrived, Phil picked us up at the Forest Hills Station of Orange Line by MBTA. \\n\\nPhil's hospitality, patience, generority, and thoughtful consideration just made us feel at home!\\n\\n Moreover, heartfelt gratitude for Phil to invite me to  Phil's family parties. Because it made my dreams of knowing your American folks life style come true!\\n\\nFor more information, as a supplement to Phil's statement, there is a Chinese Restaurant (Hong Kong 888) round the corner!\\n\\nLooking forward to staying at Phil's house again.Phil's place is well appointed and in a very nice neighborhood. There is a convenience store and a few restaurants around the corner and Roslindale Village is about a fifteen minute walk away. Getting to/from downtown Boston can take a bit of time especially during the evening or Sunday's when buses run less frequently so make sure to leave plenty of time if you have appointments there. Overall the neighborhood is very charming and Phil is great host, he's a great source of information and very responsive to any questions you may have during your stay. \"]\n",

      "  'We stayed for two nights last week, and we had an absolutely lovely experience. Her home is beautiful, inviting, and cozy, and extremely well-located a few blocks from downtown. She was very friendly and welcoming, and we felt at home right away. We very much hope to return to this lovely place!Linda is a Nice host. Good communication and helpful. The house is cozy and clean. The neighborhood is nice, safe and quiet. Bus stop is nearby and it takes around 45mins to downtown. I would stay there again.Linda was very welcoming and helpful when we arrived. The house and room were just as they had been described and very comfortable and spotlessly clean! Linda has posted brief notes in the room, bathroom and kitchen so it was easy to figure out things like towels and breakfast. \\nStaying with Linda was my first time with an airb&b place, and I will certainly be returning to her place the next time I visit my friend in Roalindale (whose house was an easy five minute walk away).  I strolled back and forth several times even late in the evening safely and comfortably.Parking on the street also turned out to be trouble free.Linda was perfect host. She has very clean house, this fact shows her respect for her guests.  I really appriciate comfortable bed in Linda\\'s house. When I was in there I was really feeling like I would have been at home.We had a wonderful stay at Linda\\'s Home. Very clean and comfy. Everything is made easy for you to respect her home. Linda was very accomodating although we arrived very late the first day, due to some traffic and border crossing. Very easy access to the city center thanks to a pass Linda leaves at disposal for her guests. We were able to leave our car in the street outside in a completely safe neighbourhood, which was perfect. All in all, a perfect stay thanks to Linda\\'s nice attentions.Linda was a wonderful host! She has everything so delightfully organized in\\n such a way that you feel very welcome in her home. She is close enough to downtown to make it easily accessible to everything and far enough that you can park on the street with no problem and feel safe. This home is just how a airbnb should be. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Linda is a wonderful host - she was fast to respond, super friendly and very informative. I appreciated her flexibility with a late arrival. She was so welcoming and checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly. Her home was very comfortable and exactly as described. The area is lovely, a quiet neighborhood close to transportation with easy access to downtown Boston. Linda even had a metro pass to make things easy. The room was just as it looks (even better, actually!)- sunny, cozy and very comfortable. This was a wonderful space to come back to after long days. It immediately felt like home away from home. I would definitely stay here again.Lovely neighbourhood. Very clean, neat tidy house. Would happily stay again.Linda was wonderfully welcoming, helpful and caring. She made us feel right at home. She\\'s a short walk from the village which has every thing you need including a fantastic cheese shop.Spotless home with very cozy room!LInda could not have been more accomodating!  She helped us with train and bus information (even providing a Charlie Card - which saved us time).  The neighborhood is lovely and we had no problem finding her location.  Room is exactly as described and the mattress was fabulous!  Her home is exactly what we were looking for, very clean, and we would definitely stay with her again on our next trip to the Boston area.  Linda is a fabulous hostess and did a great job of welcoming us as her guests and making us comfortable.  My daughter and I had a wonderful week together touring Boston and staying in a home setting rather than a cold impersonal hotel.  The bus line is very close and convenient and the train lines make getting around simple without renting a car.  Double thumbs up for this experience with AirBnB.  Thanks Linda!Linda is so welcoming! She went out of her way to make sure my mom and I felt comfortable during our stay. She is so laid back, and has such a gentle personality. The listing was absolutely as described, the neighborhood was safe and quiet, and the accommodations were beautiful. We shared a bathroom with other guests, but the bathroom is very large, and everyone is respectful of each other\\'s space and schedule. It was never awkward at all. Such a warm, friendly atmosphere all through the house. Also, Linda makes some killer carrot breakfast muffins! I definitely recommend staying with her, and would stay again myself! Thank you, Linda!Linda made my family feel very welcome and her house was very comfortable.  She had delicious muffins and coffee for us in the morning!  Highly recommend.  La casa de Linda está muy bien ubicada, cerca de las lineas de autobús. Ella se portó muy bien con nosotros y nos explicó como usar el transporte en Boston. El cuarto era muy limpio y cómodo. Recomiendo ampliamente alojarse con ellam fue una bonita experiencia.Linda was a charming and gracious host who made my visit feel like I was coming home to visit a family member. I had come to run the Boston marathon, and Linda even came to cheer me and the woman I came with on. She was excited for us to have finished as if we had been one of her family members. The room we stayed in was nicer than the photos, the beds are comfy, her place was impeccably clean and with lovely duvets. We had ample towels, hot water,  and great coffee. Having a door with a digicode is a real plus- so simple to use, and we really appreciated her having given us a metro pass to use. In short, a highly recommended places to stay with a warm and welcoming host. Linda\\'s home was as beautiful as pictured. She was a gracious hostess and provided  a lovely  breakfast. She went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and comfortable in her home. The location was near the bus stop going to the train station and into downtown.

Linda  and her roommates are all so nice and make us feel at home.  What we feel beyond expectation is the breakfast.  Linda prepared many kinds of breads, fruits and there is also juice, milk, almond milk, yogurt for your choice.  You can have eggs with butter for your toast too.  When you are busy traveling, these breakfast things make your life much easier and healthier.  \\nWe also get a lot of helpful information from the host and her roommates. It is a wonderful experience to stay there.  Linda made us feel welcome and made sure we felt at home. She gave us a Charlie Card and transportation map to use.

Most of her generous and kind deeds made our stay more than just \"comfortable\". She made us feel like we are \"at home\". My son and I want to say \"thank you\" for ALL to our hospitable Linda and say \"thank you\" to her comfy and cozy home:)We had some really great days at Linda\\'s house! There is absolutely nothing we could criticise - quiet and clean rooms, comfortable beds and such a friendly, open-minded and lovely host! Recomendation: 100%.La maison de Linda est extrêmement confortable, propre, et dans un environnement résidentiel calme et plein de charme. Nous avons été ravies de partager la cuisine avec les deux locataires qui vivent à l\\'année dans cette grande maison. Comme Linda était partie camper ce sont ces deux jeunes locataires qui nous ont accueillies et qui nous ont aidées à nous installer. Elles ont été de précieuses ambassadrices et nous les en remercions. Nous avons trouvé à quelques centaines de mètres de la maison deux épiceries et un petit resto chinois très sympa. Le seul inconvénient c\\'est la distance de la maison au Downtown : Linda nous avait procuré deux cartes Charlie pour les déplacements en bus et train. Nous les avons utilisés mais aussi nous avons utilisé Uber beaucoup plus rapide et moins cher que les taxis. Globalement très satisfaites de notre séjour, nous recommandons vivement la maison de Linda.The property was as described and was very comfortable. Linda\\'s communication was excellent and everyone was very welcoming. The house itself was very clean and tidy - we really enjoyed our stay!Linda a été très acceuillante malgré mon retard sur le plan prévu. Elle m\\'a transmis toutes les informations nécessaires et même plus, notamment les transports en ville. La maison est d\\'une tranquillité et d\\'une propreté exemplaire. Lit confortable. Le transport public est facile d\\'accès et à proximité. Ma prochaine visite à Boston sera chez Linda assurément.Linda was a great host. She responded very quiclkly and was very kind. She made us feel like we were home. She provided everything we needed for our stay and more. The house is beautiful, super clean, close to restaurants and public transportation. I would definitely stay here againz People are all very nice here, Linda\\'s a very good host and she even provided us Charlie cards. The view outside is beautiful and the house is very near to the bus station.It\\'s all in the little details. She made sure we had shower caddies and left us notes upon our arrival.Linda was warm and hospitable. Her house was very nice, comfortable and extremely clean which I appreciate very much. The neighborhood is safe and quiet and parking is no problem. She is super responsive with email and msg and is very organized and helpful. What more would anyone want? I recommend staying at Linda\\'s. ']]\n",
